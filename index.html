        <p><strong>Personal information</strong>:<br />
            My name is Hao Ta and I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. My family consists of 4 
            people, including my mother, father, older sister and I. While my nationality is Chinese, I was born in Vietnam and
            moved to Australia when I was 11 to pursue my studies. I am capable of speaking English and Cantonese. My family do 
            not own any pets at the moment but I do want to own a cat and dog in the future! I completed Year 12 at Narre Warren South
            P-12 College in 2019 and completed 2 IT courses in 2018, Software Development and Informatics as part of the VCE program.
            A fun hobby I like to indulge in is browsing Reddit! There are a lot of news articles on Reddit but also many discussions
            about various topics on there such as gaming and cooking. It's how I like to spend my free time.
            The results of the tests i did represent the dominant qualities about my personality, with some similarities between the
            Myers-Briggs test and the Big Five Personality Test. Myers-Briggs indicates that I’m a more introverted person than a social butterfly,
            and an observant person rather than directly leading others and taking action. Similarly, the Big Five Personality test
            suggests that I’m a quiet and reserved person and avoids taking on leadership roles. The learning style test indicates that
            I'm a visual learner and relies on diagrams and pictures to understand a problem, which I agree with.
