							<center><strong>Van Chanh VO</strong></center><br />
							<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Van Chanh VO and studying in RMIT with the
							student number 3748121. Vietnam is my
							nationality. Living and gaining experience in Australia are a great opportunities with me. I
							graduated English language programs and Foundation Study of science at RMIT. Spending time

							the second assignment, we discissed and decided to chose " Destiny " will be our group
							name.<br /><br />
							<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> I have done 3 tests: Myers-Briggs Test, Learning Style
							Test and Creative Test for the
							Assignment 1. The results of these test tell me about my personality to adapt for life and
							work. These results may influence a lots of my behaviour in a team. It not only shows me but
							also with me team about advantages or disadvantages of my industries. It also showing the

							<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Hao Ta and I am currently studying the
							Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT (s3844588). My family consists of 4 people,
							including my mother, father, older sister and I. While my nationality is Chinese, I was born
							in Vietnam and moved to Australia when I was 11 to pursue my studies. I am capable of
							speaking English and Cantonese. My family do not own any pets at the moment but I do want to
							own a cat and dog in the future! I completed Year 12 at Narre Warren South P-12 College in
							2019 and completed 2 IT courses in 2018, Software Development and Informatics as part of the
							VCE program. A fun hobby I like to indulge in is browsing Reddit! There are a lot of news
							articles on Reddit but also many discussions about various topics on there such as gaming
							and cooking. It's how I like to spend my free time.<br /><br />
							<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> The results of the tests i did represent the dominant
							qualities about my personality, with some similarities between the Myers-Briggs test and the
							Big Five Personality Test. Myers-Briggs indicates that I’m a more introverted person than a
							social butterfly, and an observant person rather than directly leading others and taking
							action. Similarly, the Big Five Personality test suggests that I’m a quiet and reserved
							person and avoids taking on leadership roles. The learning style test indicates that I'm a
							visual learner and relies on diagrams and pictures to understand a problem, which I agree
							with.

							<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Haochen Wang, I study in RMIT University,
							my
							student number is s3701719. I am from Jiangsu Province in China it has a long history and
							famous culture, I am now in bachelor of information technology since 20th Jun 2020, because
							I want to get some particular job to develop my talent, maybe robots’ control technology.
							After my basic information, and I will refer other of my information about something belong
							to my favor, cooking, because of COVID-19, I do afraid that takeout’s package may contain
							virus, so I learn how to cook. I have cooked many meals and I have cooked meal for many
							times, so I have more and more interests. Robotic Control is one of the branch that I want
							to explore in my major of IT study. I am experiencing java language programming and GitHub
							website operation. Now I work in assignment 2 of intro to IT subject with my group member.
							So my group’s name is “Destiny”.<br /><br />
							<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> I have got three tests: Myers-Briggs Test, Learning
							Style Test and Creativity Test. It is a good thing to get extraverted, this can makes me
							solve more and more problems. I always have intuitive energy. Besides, I have got interests
							in IT. It is good to feeling some particular systems’ working process in IT or any other
							science and technology. And then understand it. However, when it gets problem, or when we
							want to invent something unprecedent, we have to thinking. I know that in my future, I will
							face to some problems, thinking and exploring the issues is a only one method to develop,
							because when I understand the entire system and entire device, I can think and I can explore
							and fix it. Also, In my future, I want to invent something new to give people more and more
							convenience and more free time to spend on important works. This also let me think and then
							design. We have to consider before we plan. So judging is a better choice.

							<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Minwoo Tak. My student number is S3818058.
							I am currently majoring in Information Technology in RMIT. I live in South Korea where I was
							born and raised.
							My family is consisted of 3 members. My parents and me. As I don't have any brothers or
							sisters. I loved play games alone when I was young.
							Playing games is still my hobby but also a milestone that lead me to IT. As My PC when I was
							young had terrible performance so I couldnt run any game on that PC.
							It made me to look for PC components to replace. while looking for them, I learned how those
							components function in computer.
							It ignited my interest of PC-related fields. and that is why I am learning Information
							technology.<br /><br />
							<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> The result I got from the Myers-Briggs test is ISFP,
							Adventurer. People who belong to this personality type are likely to live their life with
							immediate inspirations.
							They love to break certain social frames and try different and diverse things that the
							others won't willingly try.
							I think I can utilize my personality when discussing with teammates like critical thinking
							to suggest unexpected weaknesses of idea.
							My learning style test indicates that I am a person who understand something better and
							faster with Auditory.
							I think this would function as a soft skill during the teamwork. Another test I did is a
							creativity test. I got 58.57 with this test.
							I think it shows that I am lacking of creativity a bit. but also whom should I collaborate
							with.

							<center><strong>Daniel Chong</strong></center><br />
							<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Daniel Chong, I’m currently studying
							Business Marketing at RMIT University with the student number 3713285. I moved from Malaysia
							3 years ago to pursue this degree
							and I have no regret about my decision. I believe that moving to Australia provided me with
							the push I needed to better myself as an individual and as a future marketer. I spend
							my free time playing computer games and various sports such as ultimate frisbee, football
							and basketball. I’ve always been interested in IT as I also took a coding subject back
							in college where we used Java to create a short 2D game. Taking that subject just sparked my
							interested in IT even more. Even though I was not very good at coding, knowing how games
							were made and how the codes functioned together was really interesting to me. It was like
							going backstage to a show that I’ve watched all my life, it was intriguing and exciting.
							Nowadays I’ve found myself in a continuous journey to learn more about how technology is
							really shaping our lives. Through a subject that I did in my 2nd year I was giving the
							opportunity to build a website for a small business in Melbourne, at base level it was
							nothing technically at the coding side but I always found myself wanting to know how those
							elements appeared and interacted in the website. Hence why I enrolled myself into an IT
							subject in my 3rd year that had some coding inside but also gave me more understanding of
							the
							world of IT that I fell in love with all those years ago, Introduction to IT.<br /><br />
							<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> I took 3 personality tests in Assignment 1 to access
							the type of individual I was and how my personality traits could benefit my teammates. The
							first test I carried out was the Myers-Briggs
							test and I got an INTP personality type. This means that I am a capable individual that
							strives to be better than I already am and am also open to change if it helps develop me as
							an individual.
							In a team environment, it means that I am open to new ideas and am ready to adapt for the
							team if needed. I have no problem taking the lead if needed and have no problem letting
							others take the
							lead as well.
							The second test I did was the Education Planner learning style test. Through this test I
							learned that I was predominantly a visual learner. This means that I’m the type of person
							that benefits more
							from visualizing the situation his in with the help of flash cards and color coding my
							notes. In a team environment I feel like this would affect my style of leadership as I would
							be more incline to
							ask my team to visual the problem that we are supposed to solve through the use of sticky
							notes and brainstorming using mind maps and other visual tools.
							The third test I took was a creativity test, for this test I got a score of 51.95. This
							means that I have a creativity score lower than the average but have two strong suites in
							the complexity and
							paradox branch. This means that I am able to carry large quantities of information,
							manipulate and manage the relationships between them (complexity) and have the ability to
							accept and work with contradicting
							statements (paradox). This puts me in a unique situation when it comes to creativity. I
							might not be the most creative person in the room but my willingness to work with
							contradicting and complex statements and
							try to make sense of it can add value when trying to solve a problem. In a team environment,
							my test results tell me that I would be more effective grouping myself with people that have
							a higher score in other
							creative departments like persistence, abstraction, connection and curiosity.
