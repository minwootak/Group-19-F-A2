        <p><strong>Personal information</strong>:<br />
            My name is Hao Ta and I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT (s3844588). My family consists of 4 
            people, including my mother, father, older sister and I. While my nationality is Chinese, I was born in Vietnam and
            moved to Australia when I was 11 to pursue my studies. I am capable of speaking English and Cantonese. My family do 
            not own any pets at the moment but I do want to own a cat and dog in the future! I completed Year 12 at Narre Warren South
            P-12 College in 2019 and completed 2 IT courses in 2018, Software Development and Informatics as part of the VCE program.
            A fun hobby I like to indulge in is browsing Reddit! There are a lot of news articles on Reddit but also many discussions
            about various topics on there such as gaming and cooking. It's how I like to spend my free time.
            The results of the tests i did represent the dominant qualities about my personality, with some similarities between the
            Myers-Briggs test and the Big Five Personality Test. Myers-Briggs indicates that I’m a more introverted person than a social butterfly,
            and an observant person rather than directly leading others and taking action. Similarly, the Big Five Personality test
            suggests that I’m a quiet and reserved person and avoids taking on leadership roles. The learning style test indicates that
            I'm a visual learner and relies on diagrams and pictures to understand a problem, which I agree with.
            
        <p><strong>Personal information</strong>:<br />
            My name is Haochen Wang, I study in RMIT University, my student number is s3701719. I am from Jiangsu Province in China 
            it has a long history and famous culture, I am now in bachelor of information technology since 20th Jun 2020, because I want 
            to get some particular job to develop my talent, maybe robots’ control technology. After my basic information, and I will 
            refer other of my information about something belong to my favor, cooking, because of COVID-19, I do afraid that takeout’s 
            package may contain virus, so I learn how to cook. I have cooked many meals and I have cooked meal for many times, so I have 
            more and more interests. Robotic Control is one of the branch that I want to explore in my major of IT study. I am experiencing java 
            language programming and GitHub website operation. Now I work in assignment 2 of intro to IT subject with my group member. So my group’s 
            name is “Destiny”. 
            I have got three tests: Myers-Briggs Test, Learning Style Test and Creativity Test. It is a good thing to get extraverted, this can 
            makes me solve more and more problems. I always have intuitive energy. Besides, I have got interests in IT. It is good to feeling some 
            particular systems’ working process in IT or any other science and technology. And then understand it. However, when it gets problem, 
            or when we want to invent something unprecedent, we have to thinking. I know that in my future, I will face to some problems, thinking 
            and exploring the issues is a only one method to develop, because when I understand the entire system and entire device, I can think and 
            I can explore and fix it. Also, In my future, I want to invent something new to give people more and more convenience and more free time to 
            spend on important works. This also let me think and then design. We have to consider before we plan. So judging is a better choice.
