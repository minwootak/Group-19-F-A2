								<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Van Chanh VO and studying in RMIT with
								the
								student number 3748121. Vietnam is my
								nationality. Living and gaining experience in Australia are a great opportunities with
								me. I
								graduated English language programs and Foundation Study of science at RMIT. Spending
								time
								for playing games and playing soccer are also my hobby. Interested in exploring security
								computing and developing & designing website are what I want to study in Information
								Technology course. Getting experience of developing website and java language are In my
								period of Studying Information Technology. Working in the group with developing website
								for
								the second assignment, we discissed and decided to chose " Destiny " will be our group
								name.<br /><br />

								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> I have done 3 tests: Myers-Briggs Test, Learning
								Style
								Test and Creative Test for the
								Assignment 1. The results of these test tell me about my personality to adapt for life
								and
								work. These results may influence a lots of my behaviour in a team. It not only shows me
								but
								also with me team about advantages or disadvantages of my industries. It also showing
								the
								way for my-self to changing and contributing more for the team. Finding the best fit for
								the
								role is also a part of forming the team and do not forgot for willing to commit to their
								role.<br /><br />

								<strong>Industry Data :</strong><br />
								Network engineer is the Job Titles for my group ideal job.<br />
								IT-specific skills for Netwrok engineer:<br />
								- Programming Languages
								-Computer systems and networks
								- Electrical/electronic engineering
								- Computer science
								- Computer software/computer systems engineering<br />
								General skills for Netwrok engineer:<br />
								-An analytical mind
								-An ability to learn new technologies quickly

								The three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set:
								SQL,
								Business Management and Graphic Design<br />
								The the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set:
								Leadership, mentoring and building effective relationships<br />
								After looked at the Burning Glass Data, my ideal job at Web Developer still does not
								change.
								Finding a job is an important part for me. So when looking at the Top IT Job through
								2017
								until 2018, I can see that Web Developer usually stayed in the middle of the Top IT Job
								Tittle ladder.<br />

								<strong>Career plans :</strong><br />
								Developing custom website is my ideal job. It got my attention because of the
								professional development opportunities and the opportunity for flexible working
								arrangements.Learning about Custom WordPress, CMS, PHP5, Bootstrap and JQuery are what I
								need to knowledge. In addition, understanding and learning more of designing website,
								HTML5 & CSS and JavaScript are necessary for my future.

								<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Hao Ta and I am currently studying the
								Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT (s3844588). My family consists of 4 people,
								including my mother, father, older sister and I. While my nationality is Chinese, I was
								born
								in Vietnam and moved to Australia when I was 11 to pursue my studies. I am capable of
								speaking English and Cantonese. My family do not own any pets at the moment but I do
								want to
								own a cat and dog in the future! I completed Year 12 at Narre Warren South P-12 College
								in
								2019 and completed 2 IT courses in 2018, Software Development and Informatics as part of
								the
								VCE program. A fun hobby I like to indulge in is browsing Reddit! There are a lot of
								news
								articles on Reddit but also many discussions about various topics on there such as
								gaming
								and cooking. It's how I like to spend my free time.<br /><br />

								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> The results of the tests i did represent the
								dominant
								qualities about my personality, with some similarities between the Myers-Briggs test and
								the
								Big Five Personality Test. Myers-Briggs indicates that I’m a more introverted person
								than a
								social butterfly, and an observant person rather than directly leading others and taking
								action. Similarly, the Big Five Personality test suggests that I’m a quiet and reserved
								person and avoids taking on leadership roles. The learning style test indicates that I'm
								a
								visual learner and relies on diagrams and pictures to understand a problem, which I
								agree
								with.<br /><br />

								<strong>Industry Data :</strong><br />
								The highest ranked IT specific skill from my job is
								Microsoft Windows, and the rest aren’t even ranked ( except for Microsoft Office, but
								it’s
								still ranked pretty low, indicating that my job doesn’t contain many skills that are
								required by employers. The responsibilities listed in my job suggests that I require
								problem-solving,organisation and trouble-shooting skills, all of which are ranked high
								in
								the Burning Glass data list. The 3 highest ranked IT-specific skills which aren’t in my
								required skill set are ‘SQL’, ‘JavaScript’ and ‘JAVA’, and the 3 highest ranked general
								skills which aren’t in my required skill set are ‘communication skills’, ‘writing’ and
								‘teamwork/collaboration skills’.</br>
								Looking at the Burning Glass data I can form new opinions about the job. Looking at the
								list
								of Top IT Skills from March 2018 I notice that the skills essential in my job aren’t
								ranked
								high on the list except for Microsoft Windows. This brings a small concern to me as my
								ideal
								job doesn’t require the skills in which others think is good to have, if i manage to
								land
								the job in the future but later quit i wouldn’t have the set of skills many others have
								and
								that would put me in an unfavourable situation.</br>
								The Top Generic Skills list has ‘communication skills’ as the most desired skill by a
								landslide, which doesn’t sway my opinion on my job. Other entries on the list such as
								‘problem solving’ and ‘organisation skills’ also have little influence on my opinion as
								my
								job doesn’t require much talking and more focus on desk jobs.</br>
								The Top IT Job Titles features more ‘engineer’ and ‘developer’ jobs as opposed to desk
								jobs
								and ‘support’ jobs, but overall my opinion of my ideal job still remains pretty much the
								same.<br />

								<strong>Career plans :</strong><br />
								For now I do not have a solid career plan for after the completion of my courses, but I
								aspire for a position similar to an IT Support Officer. This position appeals to me due
								to the experience that I will gain from performing the mentioned tasks and perhaps one
								day I will be able to use that knowledge for any requests that my family or relatives
								might have regarding their own systems. The company also reassures me of their
								high-quality training in order to transform me into a professional IT Support worker in
								an advanced environment.

								<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Haochen Wang, I study in RMIT
								University,
								my
								student number is s3701719. I am from Jiangsu Province in China it has a long history
								and
								famous culture, I am now in bachelor of information technology since 20th Jun 2020,
								because
								I want to get some particular job to develop my talent, maybe robots’ control
								technology.
								After my basic information, and I will refer other of my information about something
								belong
								to my favor, cooking, because of COVID-19, I do afraid that takeout’s package may
								contain
								virus, so I learn how to cook. I have cooked many meals and I have cooked meal for many
								times, so I have more and more interests. Robotic Control is one of the branch that I
								want
								to explore in my major of IT study. I am experiencing java language programming and
								GitHub
								website operation. Now I work in assignment 2 of intro to IT subject with my group
								member.
								So my group’s name is “Destiny”.<br /><br />

								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> I have got three tests: Myers-Briggs Test,
								Learning
								Style Test and Creativity Test. It is a good thing to get extraverted, this can makes me
								solve more and more problems. I always have intuitive energy. Besides, I have got
								interests
								in IT. It is good to feeling some particular systems’ working process in IT or any other
								science and technology. And then understand it. However, when it gets problem, or when
								we
								want to invent something unprecedent, we have to thinking. I know that in my future, I
								will
								face to some problems, thinking and exploring the issues is a only one method to
								develop,
								because when I understand the entire system and entire device, I can think and I can
								explore
								and fix it. Also, In my future, I want to invent something new to give people more and
								more
								convenience and more free time to spend on important works. This also let me think and
								then
								design. We have to consider before we plan. So judging is a better choice.<br /><br />

								<strong>Industry Data</strong><br />
								IT-specific skills and general skills must need ranking, especially need demands from
								employers. As an employer, I need employees need to have three of the highest skills,
								top
								three IT-specific skills and top three general skills. For IT-specific, employees need
								to
								have basic grasp like SQL, which is one important skill that need employees to
								understand
								the storage and manipulation of database. As long as IT, we need database to record.
								Then is
								JAVAscript, when refer to JAVA, we will firstly come up with one: JAVA Language
								Programming.
								This is a common program design in information technology. As long as we do understand
								programming, in the future, in our job, we can have the most accurate actions on
								computers
								without gap. Then Windows server is the third one, because Windows is the most common
								type
								of the computers, its server cares many aspects. Just pay many effects on server, we can
								have a deeper professionals in IT.<br />
								For general skills, we need to be creative, where here is a creativity, here will be
								probably a novelty. Also we need communication, this need us to build teams, thus we can
								communicate and organize, can probably solve problems. But before all the actions, we
								need
								to plan something properly. Because everything has its own process, for finishing
								without
								problems, we need planning.<br />
								I am just a newbie, I have only understand extreme little IT-specific skills, I have
								only
								one to five percent of JAVA and SQL, I have no idea about server, but I am pretty hope
								that
								I will have more and more experience after I finish postgraduate. Also, I am not so
								creative, maybe I have not touched enough eyesight in technology. Also I need to
								consider
								some ideas to solve problems by myself initially, I have to try it myself, if cannot, I
								can
								communicate. Also, I have no ability on management, because I have not do some works as
								a
								monitor, but it does not matter, in my job, I just do research in company.<br />
								I have seen the subjects in burning glass technology, because I am interested in
								robotics,
								which means robotic controlling is from a system. And it is a chance to study system
								engineering in IT as my ideal job. It can be said that my opinion just changed by a
								half.<br />

								<strong>Career plans :</strong><br />
								There are lots of branches in information technology. Compared to everyone’s career
								plans, it does not matter to ranking, everybody’s job plans are very advanced, they are
								all beneficial and also vital to the better future. Among the branches, I love robotic
								information systems the most, and the method and behavior of control as well, this is
								also important and advantageous for the future of the more advanced IT world. Which
								means I have a very ambitious career and ideal job in robotic control system’s study and
								research. This can make me understand deeper and deeper in many robot’s control systems,
								at the same time, I can understand what is suitable to construct what mechanical
								structure and also how to constitute circuits. There are a lot of robotic companies,
								including one from Australia here, called: FBR, full name: Fastbrick Robotics. This
								company produces engineering robots in constructing houses. Workers need to input a
								house’s structure and give instructions about which particular place should the robot
								work. The robot can calculate everything by putting cement or cutting brick. It is
								miraculous that the world’s first robot got invented, but it could only be programmed to
								do particular works. Currently, robots are more advanced, have the ability to learn and
								have artificial intelligence. They can calculate extremely accurately in gravity,
								parabola, distance, height, strength, angle and also strength. They can do dangerous
								work instead of humans. For example, in a biochemistry lab, gases are fatal to humans,
								so people always use AI robots, letting robots take these kinds of risks. Now I am
								pretty hopeful that artificial intelligence can have a fourth industrial revolution,
								people need to understand the current most advanced robot’s mechanical and electrical
								circuit structure, and also computer systems and controlling methods and so on. Not only
								these, we also need to explore and we can probably find more novelties.

							<div class="content-hidden" id="Minwoo">
								<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Minwoo Tak. My student number is
								S3818058.
								I am currently majoring in Information Technology in RMIT. I live in South Korea where I
								was
								born and raised.
								My family is consisted of 3 members. My parents and me. As I don't have any brothers or
								sisters. I loved play games alone when I was young.
								Playing games is still my hobby but also a milestone that lead me to IT. As My PC when I
								was
								young had terrible performance so I couldnt run any game on that PC.
								It made me to look for PC components to replace. while looking for them, I learned how
								those
								components function in computer.
								It ignited my interest of PC-related fields. and that is why I am learning Information
								technology.<br /><br />

								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> The result I got from the Myers-Briggs test is
								ISFP,
								Adventurer. People who belong to this personality type are likely to live their life
								with
								immediate inspirations.
								They love to break certain social frames and try different and diverse things that the
								others won't willingly try.
								I think I can utilize my personality when discussing with teammates like critical
								thinking
								to suggest unexpected weaknesses of idea.
								My learning style test indicates that I am a person who understand something better and
								faster with Auditory.
								I think this would function as a soft skill during the teamwork. Another test I did is a
								creativity test. I got 58.57 with this test.
								I think it shows that I am lacking of creativity a bit. but also whom should I
								collaborate
								with.<br /><br />

								<strong>Industry Data</strong><br />
								The most appropriate job listed on the Burning Glass data is network engineer.
								The way we ranked those job titles are, how much is it related to our major, or a job we
								want to be. As many of us wanted different job to get, we compared our ideal job and we
								figured out some fields that each ideal job shares. Such as major, or certain process we
								need to achieve to be employed as an ideal job, or even similarities among the works
								given
								for the job.<br />
								From your group’s ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs.
								These can be divided into general skills and IT specific skills.<br />
								- Among the skills I am required to achieve for my job, I see Microsoft windows, SQL,
								Network programming are listed on the graph. SQL and Microsoft windows are listed at the
								top
								of the graph. Which may mean, employers tend to prefer a worker with understandings or
								knowledge rather than a worker who is skilled at engineering.<br />
								- Most of general skills demanded by the employers were the skills required when working
								as
								team. The most demanded one is Communication Skills, which is most required in working
								as
								team for better cooperation and efficiency. Problem Solving also ranked right behind
								Communication skills. Which is also an essential skill to IT-related workers.<br />
								- Project management, Business management and Business analysis are the top three
								highest
								skills ranked among the skills not in my required skill set. I see these are not
								essential
								to me but I still believe some basic understandings of those skills are required. As the
								more understanding I have about how the businesses related my work go on, the better
								result
								will come out.<br />
								- I see Orientation skills, writing skills and planning skills are listed on the graph
								but
								not belonging in required skill set. Which are also not essential skills for my job.
								However, as I work as a team in this field, I believe being competent with these skills
								will
								make me more qualified. As I may face a situation where I need to report the current
								status
								of work.<br />
								- To be honest, I believed nothing else is needed as long as I achieve certain
								qualification
								for my job. Such as bachelor degree of IT-related major, or few years of apprenticeship
								or
								working experiences in similar field. However, after having looked at Burning Glass data
								which is indicating top demands of employers’ perspectives, my opinion is apparently
								changed. As Soft skills required by the employers were way heavier than I thought. I
								considered those general skills I need to achieve to get a job as certain degree having
								no
								difficulties working as a team. I also thought employers would prefer skilled worker
								regardless of how they are skilled in terms of general skills. Now I see general skills
								weigh more than I thought, as much as the employers consider the IT-specific skills the
								workers have got.<br />

								<strong>Career plans :</strong><br />
								The career plan I am expecting to take is, taking apprenticeships studying until I get
								certain certificates of qualification which are related to my major or my ideal job. As
								I want to be an IT professional with Cybersecurity, there’d be many qualifications I
								need to meet. Such as certificates which proves I have understanding how Network, or
								Operation Systems works, and what I should be aware of to prevent potential threats.
								Taking apprenticeships may help me in that way as well. As it is a great opportunity to
								obtain real experiences of my ideal job.

							<div class="content-hidden" id="Daniel">
								<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Daniel Chong, I’m currently studying
								Business Marketing at RMIT University with the student number 3713285. I moved from
								Malaysia
								3 years ago to pursue this degree
								and I have no regret about my decision. I believe that moving to Australia provided me
								with
								the push I needed to better myself as an individual and as a future marketer. I spend
								my free time playing computer games and various sports such as ultimate frisbee,
								football
								and basketball. I’ve always been interested in IT as I also took a coding subject back
								in college where we used Java to create a short 2D game. Taking that subject just
								sparked my
								interested in IT even more. Even though I was not very good at coding, knowing how games
								were made and how the codes functioned together was really interesting to me. It was
								like
								going backstage to a show that I’ve watched all my life, it was intriguing and exciting.
								Nowadays I’ve found myself in a continuous journey to learn more about how technology is
								really shaping our lives. Through a subject that I did in my 2nd year I was giving the
								opportunity to build a website for a small business in Melbourne, at base level it was
								nothing technically at the coding side but I always found myself wanting to know how
								those
								elements appeared and interacted in the website. Hence why I enrolled myself into an IT
								subject in my 3rd year that had some coding inside but also gave me more understanding
								of
								the
								world of IT that I fell in love with all those years ago, Introduction to
								IT.<br /><br />

								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> I took 3 personality tests in Assignment 1 to
								access
								the type of individual I was and how my personality traits could benefit my teammates.
								The
								first test I carried out was the Myers-Briggs
								test and I got an INTP personality type. This means that I am a capable individual that
								strives to be better than I already am and am also open to change if it helps develop me
								as
								an individual.
								In a team environment, it means that I am open to new ideas and am ready to adapt for
								the
								team if needed. I have no problem taking the lead if needed and have no problem letting
								others take the
								lead as well.
								The second test I did was the Education Planner learning style test. Through this test I
								learned that I was predominantly a visual learner. This means that I’m the type of
								person
								that benefits more
								from visualizing the situation his in with the help of flash cards and color coding my
								notes. In a team environment I feel like this would affect my style of leadership as I
								would
								be more incline to
								ask my team to visual the problem that we are supposed to solve through the use of
								sticky
								notes and brainstorming using mind maps and other visual tools.
								The third test I took was a creativity test, for this test I got a score of 51.95. This
								means that I have a creativity score lower than the average but have two strong suites
								in
								the complexity and
								paradox branch. This means that I am able to carry large quantities of information,
								manipulate and manage the relationships between them (complexity) and have the ability
								to
								accept and work with contradicting
								statements (paradox). This puts me in a unique situation when it comes to creativity. I
								might not be the most creative person in the room but my willingness to work with
								contradicting and complex statements and
								try to make sense of it can add value when trying to solve a problem. In a team
								environment,
								my test results tell me that I would be more effective grouping myself with people that
								have
								a higher score in other
								creative departments like persistence, abstraction, connection and
								curiosity.<br /><br />

								<strong>Industry Data</strong><br />
								The ideal job title I chose was to become a Product Marketing Manager for Microsoft. The
								job
								title that I have chosen is consistent in terms of the demand and growth of the job
								itself.
								According to a CMO survey done in 2018, the marketing hiring growth remains positive but
								has
								slowed down recently and saw a slight decline in 2018.<br />
								<img src="DanielChong1.png" alt="DanielChong1"><br />
								Unfortunately for me, the results from the CMO survey also concluded that companies are
								more
								inclined to outsource their marketing
								duties to marketing agencies. This would mean that my prospect of working for a big
								company
								would be tarnished but it also opens the opportunity for me to look into working with a
								marketing agency to then form a partnership with one of the big companies that I was
								previously aiming for, like Apple, Microsoft, Google and Samsung. Overall, my job
								prospect
								as a Product Marketing Manager is stable and achievable. I would just need to go through
								a
								different path then I originally was planning to take.<br />
								The general skills in my required skill set ranks very highly in terms of demand from
								employers. The general skills in my required skill set were to have creativity, good
								communication, an above average attention to detail and a willingness to learn more.
								According to the CMO survey done, creativity is the number one skill looked at by
								employers
								nowadays and curiosity was listed as the third highest. In my personal opinion, good
								communication can be included as part of having natural leadership abilities.<br />
								<img src="DanielChong2 .png" alt="DanielChong2"><br />
								As I am aiming for a non IT centred job there were not a lot of IT-specific skills
								required,
								but the job description for my ideal job did mention that applicants should have basic
								knowledge of Microsoft Office and the Adobe Suite.<br />
								The three highest ranked general skills which are not in my required skill set are
								Emotional
								Intelligence, Martech platform experience and data science background.<br />
								After analyzing the marketing industry through the CMO survey, and Australian Government
								Job
								Outlook website, my opinion on my ideal job that I chose in Assignment 1, Product
								Marketing
								Manager has not changed. The industry trend and skills required are still in my opinion,
								favorable towards the route that I am planning to for. Even though the number of
								advertisers
								and marketers have increased throughout the years (between 2014 to 2019) the future
								growth
								in demand of advertisers and marketers is at a steady pace. The skills that are needed
								for
								the job are also in-line with my skill set. For example, being proficient in the English
								language, having the ability to develop a marketing strategy, being able to creatively
								solve
								a problem and promote a product and have the ability to manage and lead a team. The
								importance of maintaining a relationship with co-workers and teammates are also valued
								highly by both the marketing industry and I. This further amplifies my beliefs that this
								is
								the right job for me to pursue as teamwork and team cohesion is of great importance to
								me.
								Overall, I am happy that my first selection for an ideal job was the right one as it
								tells
								me that I am taking the right path went it comes to my future job and future
								aspirations.<br />

								<strong>Career plans :</strong><br />
								Even though I do not have an underlining career path as of now, I do believe that
								working my way to getting my ideal job of a Product Marketing Manager in Microsoft is
								something that I should definitely continue doing. This is because it simply combines my
								two passions of marketing and IT together, being able to promote new technology that is
								coming out of one of the biggest companies in the world seems like a fever dream to me.
								But with that being said, nothing is impossible and I believe that if I work hard enough
								and perfect my craft the opportunity will arise in due time.

								<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> From China, my name is RUI QU, student id is:
								s3775860, I am studying in RMIT university and learning information technology of the
								computer network security professional, my hobby is reading history books and writing
								fiction, I want to be a computer network security engineer in the future, the reason why
								I
								chose this course, because I think the professional work sounds very cool, and my
								parents
								are engaged in profession is related to computer, so I hope I can as well as they can be
								a
								work in the computer, and it might also help to them. <br /><br />
								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> I take part in all tests .In these results, I know
								that I am diffidence man and do not like to talk with any other people, so that produce
								more
								and more people do not want to talk with me, I think that I should change this problems
								and
								do not be shy, be positive to take part in the group discussion, help any other group
								members and also ask of help initiatively. So that will make me know more useful
								information
								about my subject. I also consider that logical thinking is more important than emotion,
								so
								that will make me think more and will not be swayed by emotion, so I want to help my
								group
								member to do more rational thinking. I already have imagination and that will help me to
								think a lot of strange ideals, that will help my group members to have better
								choices.<br /><br />
								<strong>Industry Data</strong><br />
								I hope that is engaged in the industry for the IT aspects of the computer network
								security
								engineer, from "burning glass data" provided to my statistics, currently in Australia
								and
								New Zealand IT jobs demand by about 2-5 years work experience, but for the 0-2 years
								working
								experience, they are still popular, from a deeper perspective, New Zealand and Australia
								in
								the IT industry in the job market is far from saturation degree, and the number of job
								network security while relative to the entire IT industry accounts for the relatively
								small,
								but have some opportunities are greater than the average in the IT industry.<br />
								According to the data shows that the system is currently in development for Linux and
								Windows system requirements is still more than apple's IOS system, the programming
								language
								Java and c # operation is still the most popular face object language, but it is not
								difficult to find that with the progress of science and technology, the Python language
								and
								ignored before the front end of the development is gradually emerging. What I need to
								learn
								includes C language, Java, PHP, C#. In the Java language, the spring framework of Java
								Web
								is required, while Tomcat of Asp/Vet is required in C#. Among those using Linux, I think
								the
								best choice is Ubuntu, which is now the most widely used operating system.<br />
								As far as database is concerned, the main categories are “Micsoft SQL
								Sever”,”Oradel”,”SQL
								Lite” and “My SQL”. For Australia, “Micsoft SQL Sever” is used the most, “Oradel” is
								used
								second, then “SQL Lite” and “My SQL”. And I will take the top two database types as my
								main
								study direction. In addition, I also need to learn front-end Javascript scripting
								language
								and HTML framework language, so that I can master more technologies in IT more
								efficiently.
								At present, SAP, IOS system and Python are not of great help to my current industry, and
								they will waste a lot of my time. Therefore, I will spend less time in learning these
								three
								IT technologies in the future.<br />
								In addition, if I want to be engaged in the NETWORK security technology industry of IT
								in
								the future, I need to learn more communication skills, problem solving ability, writing
								ability, leadership, guidance ability, organization ability, logical thinking ability,
								teamwork and communication skills, etc. But for the present my career, the most
								important is
								undoubtedly logical thinking ability, the second is teamwork and communication skills
								ability, finally, the writing and the ability to solve the problem, because these skills
								can
								better help me think of the possibility of more, strengthen the work and communication
								skills with others, thus greatly facilitated my writing and deal with the problem of
								efficiency, for the present I, guiding ability, leadership and organization skills but
								no
								less important, after all, now I'm at the new stage, the management level of things for
								a
								while is still hard to come into contact with, These abilities can be learned later when
								I
								have enough knowledge.<br />
								To sum up, again after I watched the "burning glass data”, before I change my childish
								view
								of IT and network safety engineering technology, I found if I want to learn the subject,
								to
								the type of knowledge needed to design and utility is huge, IT's not that I imagine that
								only need to learn how to write a program, so I will spend more time on this respect
								knowledge reserve, strive for the early work to reach the required standard.<br />

								<strong>Career plans :</strong><br />
								I choose the information technology because i want to study more useful information
								about the security of the internet, my computer always has a lot of computer virus, that
								produce many problems in my life, so i think that if i know how to protect my computer,
								that will not only help me to know more information and skills to defend my computer,
								but also can help me to find a job about the computer network security, such as net
								police, network security engineer…

								The reason why I want to choose the work of computer network security is that, on the
								one hand, the work pay of computer network security is relatively high, and it has a
								good prospect; on the other hand, it can bring me a lot of convenience in my life, and
								can help me quickly solve some computer network security problems in my life. I hope to
								study computer network security knowledge, such as: applied cryptography, protocol layer
								security, windows security (attack and defense), Unix / Linux Security (attack and
								defense) firewall technology, intrusion monitoring system, audit and log analysis.

								In conclusion, all of us are interested in IT related career paths. The fact that all of
								us have different career paths but are in some aspects related to each other is an
								indicator of how much modern society has increasingly embraced technology in their daily
								lives more and more. The world of IT is in modern times so much broader now. We all came
								to RMIT university with the same goal of graduating but leave with different degrees in
								the same field. Some of us are planning on taking jobs that require more of an
								engineering aspect, such as Hoachen’s desire to work with robotics and develop code for
								AI learning. Some of us are looking for a more traditional office work environment, with
								Minwoo looking at cyber security, Hao Ta as an IT support officer and Rui as a computer
								network security specialist as their career paths. And others are looking to help
								businesses see the value of having an online presence and making profit off of it with
								Van aspiring to become a website developer and Daniel becoming a marketing manager. It
								is just amazing how our paths are different yet so similar at the same time.

						<h3>Clouds, Services, Servers</h3>
						<img src="Clouds, services, servers .png" alt="Clouds, Services, Servers">
					</center>
					<p>
						<strong>What does it do? <br /></strong>
						Clouds are certain physical storages but which are accessible whenever, wherever the user wants
						to upload and download. An example we can find around us is Google drive. It offers the user
						certain amount of data storage. The user can buy his own hard disk drive, but it is difficult to
						manage if the data the user want to store is heavy. The user cannot also access the data unless
						it is the same PC that has the hard disk drive with data in it. To solve these difficulties,
						Clouds offer a huge data storage with a service that user can access via internet or certain
						client. In this way, user don’t need to buy a new hard disk drive for the data, nor need to use
						the only one device to access the data stored.<br />
						Servers are a set of computers that works together, but with many computers in it. Servers have
						diverse and numerous purposes. There are Web servers, Database servers, and game servers.
						Firstly, Web servers are used for hosting webpages. They take inputs the user makes, and process
						the input taken, and display outputs as graphical change. Simple example for that be like a
						searching via Internet. If you search on Google, you put your words in the searching Bar, as an
						input, Google processes your input, by searching websites with keyword you offered, and displays
						the results. Database servers are where the data is stored. They host a big storage as an
						internet page or certain client. Similar to Clouds. An example can be found in real life is
						Wiki. They store various documents which is written via internet. Lastly, Game servers are where
						all the interactions in the game are processed, if you assume you are playing a game, you may
						move your character to somewhere. Your game client sends your current location to the server,
						and updates your character’s status.<br />
						Services: The services that we commonly find in real life are mainly cloud storages. There are
						Onedrive, Google drive, Icloud as well known, and many other cloud storages now commonly used.
						But there are other services based on Cloud computing. Cloud games, are also new kind of Cloud
						services. Google Stadia, Project Xcloud and Play station now are currently well-known Cloud game
						services. User pays certain amount of fee monthly, and play games, but with Video game consoles,
						PCs, or even Phones. As the game is not actually running on their devices, but being delivered
						from the Clouds by streaming. There might be certain delays in interacting with cloud. As they
						are physically not connected and network environment affects the connection quality
						significantly. However, despite of those disadvantages like delay between inputs and outputs, it
						has tremendous demand as the users do not need to buy or own a high-end PC to run a game. It is
						apparently reasonable for the consumers to pay monthly rather than buying PC. There is another
						branch of Cloud computing. Amazon web services, and Microsoft Azure are Cloud computing
						platform. They offer certain servers operated via Clouds. They offers a lot of things from
						hosting a webpage to data storages.<br />
						<strong>What is the Clouds,services,servers likely impact?<br /></strong>
						. More convenient use and storage: For some small and medium-sized enterprises, with the
						continuous expansion of their business, they may need to carry out capacity expansion and
						upgrading operations in the later period. If they use cloud host, there is no need to carry out
						corresponding upgrading operation of hardware and software in the later period. In addition,
						cloud hosts have a data backup function, which greatly reduces the chance of data being affected
						or lost. As cloud servers are maintained uniformly by service providers, they save a lot of
						human resources for enterprises.<br />
						. The stability of cloud server is relatively good: cloud server is a clustered server. For
						network attacks and other damage to the server has a higher defensive behavior.<br />
						. Faster response: The bandwidth used by the cloud host is interoperable by multiple lines, and
						the response speed is very fast.<br />
						<strong>Cloud computing servers mainly provide Internet-based infrastructure services for smes
							and
							high-end users. This user group has the following characteristics:<br /></strong>
						(1) The main business is host rental and virtual private server, and the scale is relatively
						large.<br />
						(2) Pay attention to the short-term return on investment, and have high requirements on the cost
						performance of products.<br />
						(3) Strong personalized demand, tend to the whole value chain products.<br />
						Compared with the existing VPS and rented physical servers, users can easily carry out remote
						maintenance and achieve complete isolation between cloud hosts at the hardware level of the
						reinstallation system for free. Built-in redundant Shared storage and intelligent backup,
						physical server failure can be automatically restored within a few minutes; The service
						environment USES high-end servers for deployment and centralized management and monitoring to
						ensure the stability and reliability of the business.Stronger host performance, the overall
						performance is much higher than VPS, stronger than some independent servers; Cloud servers cost
						less to rent than traditional physical servers and require no deposit. With fast supply and
						deployment capability, users can open the cloud host in real time after submitting the
						application for renting, and get the service immediately. Business support smooth expansion,
						when the user business scale expansion, can quickly achieve business expansion.<br /><br />
						<strong>How will Clouds,services,servers affect you?<br /></strong>
						To me, the role of cloud servers in today's world is no doubt comparable to the emergence of
						power plants in the industrial age. First of all, before the birth of cloud server, if I wanted
						to develop a software or website by myself, I had to purchase the server by myself and conduct
						daily inspection, debugging and maintenance. At present, if I want to develop software or
						website, I can use it directly from the operator concession server, which can greatly save my
						cost and energy and enable me to focus more on the development and application of the website
						itself. Just as with the advent of power stations in the industrial age, more people did not
						have to worry so much about how to get electricity, so they could spend more energy on how to
						use it.Subject to the restrictions of money, so I can't afford to buy a complete server,
						erection and maintenance, and with the emergence of the cloud, I this kind of independent
						developers can also be developed through its excellent Internet program, thereby significantly
						reducing the costs of my independent development and threshold, and attract more and more people
						in making more excellent program, so I for the junior programmer, gave me more reference
						learning opportunities, improve the ability of my core employment after graduation.As my family
						is not the developer of computer programs, the emergence of cloud servers has a relatively small
						impact on them, more reflected in the protection of personal privacy information, as well as the
						microcomputer virus defense detection ability has been significantly improved. In addition, due
						to the emergence of the cloud to cloud, the cloud computing, artificial intelligence, Internet,
						chain blocks, and a series of cloud product technology, greatly facilitate the daily life of
						people, in various fields in transforming our world gradually, make my family better able to
						enjoy the fun and convenience brought about by the cloud server, greatly improve their
						well-being and quality of life.

						<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
						<img src="Cybersecurity.jpg" alt="Cybersecurity">
					</center>
					<p>
						<strong>What does it do?<br /> </strong>
						One of the overarching challenges in the field of cybersecurity is its complexity and poor
						definition. In most other fields, the research community explores the boundaries of the research
						field while building on a core body of knowledge assembled over time. In contrast, the
						boundaries of the field of cybersecurity are constantly and rapidly evolving and it can be
						challenging to identify which areas have been researched and which ones remain overlooked or
						poorly understood. The field has a number of research gaps, for instance, there is a lack of
						research into national security issues, governance, ethics and legal concerns. Research in the
						field of cybersecurity seems to suffer from a scarcity of reliable, verifiable data, and
						particularly large scale, longitudinal datasets, across many of the clusters.The increased
						dependency on ICTs across society poses a challenge for governments in terms of how to best
						organise the governance of cybersecurity at a national level. It is increasingly important that
						countries anticipate, detect, mitigate and prevent a wide range of cybersecurity incidents and
						attacks, as well as coordinate these efforts between the public and private sector, both
						domestically and across international borders.Cybersecurity cannot be achieved without having
						access to appropriate levels of suitably qualified and experienced cybersecurity professionals.
						There is a range of human behaviours in cyberspace that compromise systems and render security
						protocols ineffective. Humans are continually a source of weakness for secure information
						systems, given that individual behaviours can lead to insecure activities (e.g. password re-use)
						and are vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g. phishing, impersonation,
						shoulder-surfing, etc.). Individual behaviour may also jeopardise other security interventions.
						Society simultaneously produces and consumes increasing volumes of data. As society increasingly
						relies on data and progressively autonomous analysis or decision-making aids – through
						technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence – it will become increasingly
						crucial to verify and assure data and emerging decision-making techniques to ensure that they
						are accurate and without bias and prejudice.
						With technology becoming more ubiquitous, being used in every sector, and replacing all kinds of
						manual tasks, we are becoming more dependent on computer-related hardware and software than ever
						before. There is therefore a significant need to ensure that there are appropriate mechanisms to
						test, certify, verify and assure that systems used across all aspects of society are secure and
						perform as expected – and continue to do so throughout their lifecycle. Cybersecurity failures
						can be caused by bad design, failure to implement appropriate cybersecurity arrangements, and
						human error.<br />
						There will be more hackers and they will continue to become more sophisticated with access to
						better tools. Small and medium-sized businesses will be targeted more often as many of these
						businesses lack information security knowledge and resources making them ideal targets.
						Additional privacy and cyber regulation will continue to be developed forcing businesses to take
						cyber security more seriously. Hackers will continue to be more sophisticated, using new methods
						and tools to gain access to private information. To defend against such cyberattacks, companies
						will need to use more effective security solutions with innovative approaches. For instance,
						companies will assess their cybersecurity as seen from the hacker’s point of view. The goal will
						be to not only increase cyber resilience internally within their specific company, but also
						across the company’s supply chain. The future of cybersecurity should have a heavy focus on
						using artificial intelligence (AI) to secure devices and systems in the increasingly connected
						world. The future of cybersecurity will center around industry adoption of 5G networks. 5G
						technology will enable billions of new devices to be connected to the Internet – with more
						speed, density and efficiency than ever seen before.. Therefore, 5G will result in a rise in
						cybersecurity concerns as hackers are provided greater access to entire networks, from remote
						sensors to self-driving cars and smart devices in supply chains worldwide.<br /><br />

						<strong>What is the likely impact? <br /> </strong>
						Nowadays, the necessity of cybersecurity is indispensable. Many countries are well aware of
						threats to cybersecurity and this is a main issue. Cyber attack will lead to information theft,
						sensitive data such as government data, hospital data and celebrity infomation. They are even
						spread harmful information, cheating and disrupting the operation of telecommunications
						networks, internet to cripple the system and making the data unavailable. Increasingly, cyber
						attack are going to grow stronger and faster in the future. With the development of
						cybersecurity, it will help to protect many informations and datas from theft, interruption,
						damage or other unauthorized or wrong actions. The people I say are affected the most here, are
						organizations, companies, governments, social media users and even users realate to internet.
						There are many companies are having cyber-attacked and without cybersecurity, the data of these
						company will be thieve and decrease the customer's believe of this them. So, how can we take
						benefits from cybersecurity? There are many answers for this question. First, cybersecurity will
						protect company, helping your employees to surf the internet at anytime they need and ensure
						that they do not have potential threats. Furthermore, with opportunities of spreading the virus
						and thieve informations and datas from other internet users or even customers of companies then
						selling or taking from that. As we can see, cybersecurity will protect and safety your
						information. Moreover, cybersecurity help you to work safe by protecting from potential network
						attack and virus forcing you to replace the computer. Preventing your website going down is what
						cybersecurity will protect. If company websites or normal user websites contain virus, so thoes
						websites can forced to shut down and maybe it will causing long term damage to the system. The
						cybersecurity jobs are in high demand and there seems to be demand for many security
						professionals in the future. Moreover, the role of computer science is in high demand and will
						increase in the future, so cybersecurity are creating many jobs and technologies now and time
						ahead.<br /><br />

						<strong>How will this affect you? <br /> </strong>
						Cybercriminals are becoming more and more frequent and dangerous because they can cause loss of
						privacy, confidentiality and privacy of personal data. It might be effect significant to
						reputational and financial losses. In my daily life, using technologies carefully on internet to
						avoid virus, receiving wrong information and especially cyber-crime. With some basic behavior, I
						can reduce the risk of cyber-crime and feel ut as a part of my daily life. First, avoid randomly
						password by protect my account with strong and unique passwords and combination of 10 uppercase
						and lowercase with letters, symbols and numbers. Also changing the password in every three
						months, so it will make more difficult for attackers to access my information. Secondly, do not
						be curious about messages, emails or attachments that I feel unsafe. In some ways, message can
						come from a cyber-criminal who compromised my friend or family member's mail or social media
						account. Finally, understand and being control when using public internet networks. Everything
						doing on the website or application can be steal, so avoid anything that involves sharing my
						personal information.

						<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
						<img src="MachineLearning.jpg" alt="MachineLearning">
					</center>
					<strong>What does it do? <br /></strong>
					Machine learning is defined as an algorithm that uses statistics to find patterns in massive amounts
					of data (Hao 2018). Machine learning has become essential in our everyday lives, its used everywhere
					from the recommendation systems in YouTube and Spotify to the voice assistants like Siri and Alexa
					(Hao 2018). As time has gone by people are starting to be more comfortable with machine learning
					becoming a part of their lives, this can be seen with the increase in acceptance of home smart
					devices such as the Google Home Mini and Amazon Echo. Tankovska (2020) claimed that there was a 36
					million unit increase in smart home device sales from 2017 to 2018. As a result, we as a society
					have become more accepting of machine learning in our lives. Humans have embraced the idea of a
					world where machine learning can help make their lives easier. My groupmate touched on the topic of
					AI technology in robots, machine learning is an essential part of that process as well. ‘Artificial
					Intelligence applies machine learning, deep learning and other techniques to solve actual problems’
					Thompson (n.d., para.10). A simple way to look at machine learning is by looking at the
					advertisements (ads) recommended to you by Google. For example, if I were to search ‘Nike shoes’ on
					Google and close the tab afterwards I would most definitely get ads about Nike shoe promotions
					happening around my area. This is Google trying to ‘learn’ what I am interested in and in the
					process of collecting my data try to cater to my needs and wants.<br />
					One of the advancements done in recent years in regards of machine learning is DeepMind’s continued
					development of their AI. In 2019, DeepMind set out to master a tactical game called StarCraft 2. The
					aim was to develop an AI that could adapt to the complexity of the game and compete against
					professionals in the game (Garisto 2019). This isn’t the first time that DeepMind has done this, in
					previous years they challenged themselves by developing AIs that could compete and beat
					professionals in basics games like chess and Go (Garisto 2019). But StarCraft 2 is a step above
					those games in terms of complexity and unpredictability. StarCraft 2 is a game that has hundreds of
					pieces moving simultaneously in real time and at random. Unlike chess, pieces in StarCraft 2 can
					move anywhere they like and most of the time players in StarCraft 2 can not see what their opponents
					are doing. Even though this might sound impossible to do can somewhat farfetched, the DeepMind team
					was able to develop an AI that could not only compete against professionals in the game but also
					defeat 2 of them in the testing process. In addition to that, the AI was put into the game’s
					European servers and achieved a grandmaster rating, placing within the top 0.15% of the region’s
					90,000 player base (Garisto 2019).<br />
					The sky is the limit for what we can achieve through machine learning. Neo (2019, para. 3) stated
					that, ‘today, the error rate in humans is only 3% in computer version. This means computers are
					already better at recognizing and analyzing images than humans’. This advancement in computer vision
					can pave the way to AI technology helping in the medical field. These AI computers can be used to
					make their own diagnosis or even work alongside doctors to ensure the credibility of their
					diagnosis. ‘Generally, the purpose of computer vision in the medical field is to replicate the
					expertise of specialists and deploy it places where people need it the most’ (Neo 2019, para.
					6).<br />

					<strong>What is the likely impact? <br /></strong>
					Machine learning enables computers to learn and act without being explicitly programmed. It evolves
					from the study of pattern recognition and the design and analysis of algorithms to enable learning
					from data and make possible data-driven predictions or decisions. Machine learning can dramatically
					increase the speed and accuracy of climate models. Machine learning is essential to the development
					of intelligent cars that can make quick unprogrammed decisions based on data, and to ensuring cars
					function safely. Machine learning can help contribute to the medicine field, allowing machines to
					analyze a plethora of patients' data with greater speed than humans’, and suggest treatments that
					may be overlooked by doctors.Small errors or bias in data may be magnified in the long run as
					machines will train on the faulty inputs, leading to decisions not best for us. Machines that
					operate on large amounts of unrelated data may find patterns or correlations in the data that are
					meaningless or useless, or actionable but wrong/inefficient.Back in 2016, the computer program
					“AlphaGo” defeated Lee Sedol, the Go world champion. Go is an ancient Chinese game, much more
					difficult for computers to master than chess. But AlphaGo was specifically trained to play Go, not
					by simply analyzing the moves of the very best players, but by learning how to play the game better
					from practicing against itself millions of times. I imagine in the future the bots that we play
					against will be much more intelligent and similar to almost playing against another human.Airplanes
					are already implemented with transportation automation - using “Flight Management System”, a
					combination of GPS, motion sensors and computer systems to track its position during flights.
					Self-driving cars however are more complicated, with more cars and obstacles on the road, and
					limitations to account for in terms of traffic lights and rules. Machine learning should allow
					self-driving cars to instantaneously adapt to changing road conditions, while learning from new
					roads at the same time. Cars currently require a driver present for safety, so in the future machine
					learning should allow so that cars can detect and follow driving conditions to drive
					safely.<br /><br />
					<strong>How will this affect you?<br /></strong>
					Machine learning is becoming more and more frequent in our daily life. As we can see. AI used to be
					a fanciful concept from science fiction, but now it’s becoming a daily reality. Taking the benefits
					and powers from machine learning, it will help us to gain the effect of a healthy life, happier and
					more successful. Machine learning is not only replace manual labor, but also mental labor.
					Self-Driving cars are the artificial intelligence and machine learning impact strongly in our
					everyday life. It is the accessibility for those people who cannot drive or even people who do not
					life driving or even scare of driving. Machine learning help us to reduce the pollution of
					atmosphere, also even noise pollution... To make the idea of the sentence above more solid,
					self-driving cars will be a typical representative. Moreover, making digital empathy and robots as
					friends are the big step of machine learning. As can we see, the day that we can " buy a friend" is
					not too far away. Furthemore, machine learning in health care section is a very important that
					cannot be ignored. Machine learning can help bridge the " knowledge gap" in medicine. It allow
					machines to anylyze many of patient data with much greater speed than humans are capable of, and
					suggest diagnoses or treatments that may be overlooked by the physician.

						<h3>Robots</h3>

					</center>
					<strong>What does it do? <br /></strong>
					Interest and adoption of robotics in our everyday lives has increase in recent years. Robots have
					been used to substitute people on jobs that are high in difficulty and jobs that are perceived to be
					too dangerous for the ordinary working-class person. For example, in 2016 a professor, Oussama
					Khatib and his team from Stanford University programmed and built a humanoid robotic diver named,
					OceanOne and went on an expedition to recover treasures from the King Louis XIV’s wrecked flagship,
					a ship that before that expedition had never been touched before (Carey 2016). That was just one of
					the many amazing things that modern robotics have enabled us to achieve. Robots have also been used
					to construct particular objects like cars. For example, the automotive giants, KIA have 62 humans
					and 242 robots in the welding shop alone helping build the car at a faster rate of 90 minutes (John
					Hughes 2011). Robots have also been used for simple tasks such as lifting boxes, identifying those
					boxes, and sorting them according to the product code allocated to them via the unique barcode given
					to each and every one of those boxes. This can be seen implemented by e-commerce giants Amazon at
					their Amazon warehouse near the Denver airport, the sorting robots will hold flat packages on its
					top and scan the barcode using a red laser dot. When a button on the side of the robot is pressed,
					the robot goes on to safely sort the package to its designated location (Simon 2019).<br />
					The popularity of domestic robots has also been increasing over the years. With the likes of the
					XIAOMI Mi Robot and iRobot increasing in popularity it has paved the way to an overall higher
					acceptance rate of robots being around people domestically. This can be seen in the development of
					small domestic robots like the Anki Cozmo and Anki Vector. These robots act as companion robots,
					showing emojis on their screens to imitate a person’s behaviour and attitude towards a good or bad
					situation. Some domestic robots are also used to play music and even dance, they are there to make
					people feel happy and accompanied. Currently, robots’ highest technological level is artificial
					intelligence (AI). In a post explaining what Artificial Intelligence is, the Accenture (n.d., para.
					1) stated that, ‘AI is a constellation of technologies—from machine learning to natural language
					processing—that allows machines to sense, comprehend, act and learn’. They can think and learn like
					a human being, even acting instinctively as situation turns thanks to constant exposure to
					situations where researchers challenge the AI to learn and adapt to the situation at hand. For
					example, the Cruzr Health Monitoring robot, it is currently being used to help ease the weight of
					the health workers during this pandemic. It can detect someone’s body temperature, conduct screening
					and whether a person is wearing a mask (RobotLAB 2020). If something abnormal is detected, it will
					automatically notify everyone in its operating area such as the airport. Although robotic technology
					has advanced rapidly throughout the years, it is not completely self-reliant yet. For example,
					Boston Dynamics, an American robotic company has a famous robot Atlas. This robot is advanced, it
					can be autonomous, they can detect obstacles by themselves, they can carry boxes and even walk
					through textured ground and narrow bridges without falling. But they are very slow when walking
					through textured areas. Even though Boston Dynamics have been working on these types of projects for
					10 years, they still were not able to build a robot that could fully imitate human movement through
					textured terrains.<br />
					Nevertheless, their achievements with the Atlas are sensational. Building a robot that can adapt to
					its surrounding areas and leap over obstacles was somewhat of a fever dream to the world a few years
					ago.<br />
					So where do we go from here? The advancement in AI robotics is going to grow substantially in the
					next two to three years. AI technology learns as time passes by and with Boston Dynamics continued
					efforts to deliver a capable and reliable humanoid robot, as the AI learns more and adapts more I am
					positive that the people at Boston Dynamics will provide hardware that can match the intensity of
					any situation they put their robot in. Other than that, other advancements by companies such as
					Tesla with their electrical self-driving cars and Hanson Robotics with Sophia is something to be
					hopeful about. All these achievements points to a more technology centred future. As time goes by
					technological parts get cheaper and more available to the public (Joshi n.d.). This in theory would
					spark more interest in more complex parts of technology. Sparking a birth of interested, hopeful and
					tech savvy individuals that can help advance our society towards a more efficient technology centred
					world.<br />
					<strong>What is the likely impact? <br /></strong>
					The likely impact of an increase in development of robot technology is the decrease in work
					opportunities for humans. This can be seen in the increase in use of fully automated coffee machines
					in various hotels around the world and the use of robots for various other tasks that are typically
					easily done by a human being. Thomas (2020) stated that robots in Germany are starting to perform
					functions typically done by humans, such as caring for the elderly and even ferrying toilet paper.
					This can be concerning for the working class as Thomas (2020) has also stated that because of the
					increase in use of robots in the workplace, a lot of people are going to fall by the wayside,
					countless jobs will be automated or will disappear entirely. This will inevitably cause an increase
					in unemployment around the world in industries such as vehicle manufacturing, shipment and food and
					beverages. We have already been given a glimpse into the future of the food and beverages industry
					with the implementation of Cobots in place of waiters in various restaurants around the world.
					Cobots are robots that work along side humans that can perform simple tasks such as serving or
					vending food items (Joshi 2020). Overall, the continuous improvements in robotics will lead to a
					world where interaction between robots and humans will be the norm and will also lead to an increase
					in adoption of robotics in various sectors. <br /><br />

					<strong>How will this affect you?<br /></strong>
					It can affect me very much, not only me, but everyone, they can substitute me to do works that makes
					me feel happier and happier to see higher and higher technology, when I in working career, robots
					makes me get affected about my knowledges and understandings of robotic control, design, structure
					and system. If better, I can become a scientist on robotic development. In my home, robots can do
					works, when they do works, they do substitute me to do, because I can be very busy and at the same
					time, I still want my house to keep clean and tidy, so robots can do it. Also it can give me much
					more fun and entertainments. Also, it can help me solve problems. For example, if I find something
					goes wrong when I do some works, robot can tell me what to do by Cloud Web. In my daily life, it can
					help me make my life convenient and reduce trivial time. It can help me make up some projects
					without any mistakes and without any gaps. If I work in hospital, robots can identify who is serious
					patient to reduce risk of infection. We all know that in previous era, people can only program the
					particular actions and movements in robot’s “unadvanced brain” although they invent robots, but they
					still need to do complex works by themselves. Now robots are advanced, even have ability to think
					and act as a human, people and I can have convenient life and have much more enough time to do
					something which I must finish in certain time. Of course, robots can have better affects on members
					of my family and my friends. Currently, robots can identify face and fingerprint of particular
					person to know him or her. When my family members or friends having party, I can tell the robots to
					do something like have fun with us, or tell the robots to do something about service, if I tell the
					robots that Jack want a glass of apple juice, robots can use its data storage to find apple, glass
					and juicer it puts in particular place and make juice, it can identify Jack’s face by its recording
					database and send juice to him.

					<h2>Project Idea</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					<center><strong>AI LEARNING HOME SYSTEM</strong></center>
					Our project will be an AI system circuit breaker that operates based on its users usage of home
					electronics. The AI hardware will require the internet in order to study patterns and send
					information to its software, where a coded program receives information from various household
					items
					and teaches itself to turn off certain electronics at certain times. It allows the platform to
					connect to other electronic devices via home wi-fi, and it learns the frequency of usage and
					time
					the electronics are used. Once it finishes learning, it automatically turns off the devices to
					prevent excess electricity consumption and thus bringing less electricity fee for those who
					spend
					their day out of the house or those that forget to turn off power.

					The AI hardware operates by connecting to various household electronics like ‘TV’, ‘microwave’
					and
					‘coffee maker’, and once it does so the software registers the times it is turned off, repeating
					for
					at least a week so that the software can develop a pattern and can turn on an electronic
					accordingly. Not only will this be convenient for users, from the AI automatically turning off
					the
					coffee maker or TV everyday at a set time in case the homeowners forget to do so, but the main
					benefit of owning this AI system is that it will help save electricity and decrease any standby
					power from all electronics in the house, as they still consume electricity even when they aren’t
					being used, thus lowering the costs in energy bills.
				</p>
				<p>
					As we live in the era of technology, the use of electronic devices is growing in huge numbers.
					Owning more than 3 electronic devices including PC, smartphones, or a smartwatch is no longer a
					rare
					scene now. However, there are several problems occurred due to the increased number of
					electronic
					devices uses. The major problem is electricity. There is a term called ‘Standby power’. Standby
					power is an electricity consumption when the devices are turned off or not in use. As they must
					have
					electricity to turn itself on. The more the electronic devices each household has, the more
					Standby
					power consumption will be caused. electricity fees will be paid due to the increased electricity
					consumption for sure. According to the graph below: <br />
					<center><img src="motivation.png" alt="motivation"><br /></center>
					It shows 39.4 watts are consumed per household daily. It is also shown that the Standby power
					consumption takes 5.9% of residential electricity consumption. The graph also indicates that 2.6
					million CO2 emissions are created while generating the equal amount of electricity. 93 dollars
					per
					house hold a year may not be that big to someone, but in a global scale, it is big money. Which
					can
					be used for improving our quality of life, or for other policies for better society.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Intelligent lighting<br /></strong>
					Intelligent lighting is mainly to realize the intelligent control and management of the lighting
					of
					the
					whole living space. It can realize the effect of remote control on and off, dimming, full
					opening
					and
					full closing of the lighting in living space by remote control and other intelligent control
					methods. It
					can also realize the functions of timing control, telephone remote control, computer local and
					Internet
					remote control, so as to achieve the energy-saving, environmental protection and comfort of
					intelligent lighting Suitable and convenient functions.<br />

					<strong>Intelligent electrical appliances<br /></strong>
					Electrical control can use remote control, timing and other intelligent control methods to
					realize
					intelligent control of water dispenser, socket, air conditioning, floor heating, projector,
					fresh
					air system, etc. in order to avoid water quality being affected by repeated heating of water
					dispenser at night, disconnect plug-in and power on when going out to avoid safety
					accidents.<br />

					<strong>Sun Shade<br /></strong>
					A complete intelligent sunshade system can automatically adjust the angle of blinds or make
					overall
					lifting and lowering according to the changes of surrounding natural conditions. It can not only
					block radiant heat, reduce direct sunlight, avoid glare, but also make full use of natural light
					to
					save energy.<br />

					<strong>Energy saving control<br /></strong>
					Smart home can adjust the power and other factors according to the specific use situation and
					frequency, so as to achieve the advantages of environmental protection and saving.<br />

					<strong>Remote meter reading<br /></strong>
					It is a system that automatically collects and processes data of various instruments (such as
					water
					meter, electricity meter, gas meter, etc.) by means of communication and computer technology. To
					solve the problem of automatic meter reading, it mainly solves the problems such as disturbing
					people, not timely reporting data and inconvenient management caused by door-to-door meter
					reading.
					Automatic meter reading has become a standard configuration in the intelligent community of real
					estate construction project, just like building intercom system.e<br />

					<strong>Systems software<br /></strong>
					System software refers to the third-party software that is independent of the smart home system
					product manufacturer. The third-party software enterprise can develop and control the mainstream
					smart home system by reaching the bottom level agreement with the smart home system product
					manufacturer and cooperating with the application level to realize intelligent lighting control,
					intelligent electrical control, intelligent temperature control, intelligent video control,
					intelligent curtain control and intelligent security Control, intelligent remote control,
					intelligent timing control, intelligent network control, intelligent remote control, intelligent
					scene control and other functions of software.<br />

					<strong>System network<br /></strong>
					At present, the two most popular home network types are wireless and Ethernet. In both types,
					routers perform most of the work, controlling communication between interconnected devices..
					Many
					new routers combine wireless technology with Ethernet technology and include hardware firewalls.
					Common products of home network include:<br />
					1) Computer<br />
					2) Server<br />
					3) Router<br />
					4) ADSL Modem<br />
					5) Storage device<br />
					Communication and network equipment in the home, including smart home system, can be connected
					to
					the outside world through the home network. At the same time, the servers and computers in the
					home
					network have strong computing and graphic computing capabilities, which can assist or cooperate
					with
					video monitoring system and home energy management system to complete more powerful video
					information processing and data calculation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The tech needed for this project is a Wi-Fi and mobile application compatible circuit breaker that
					helps the user save electricity primarily through AI learning. This can be accomplished by using
					Arduino based products and Arduino compatible products as they are compact, easy to obtain and easy
					to implement due to its open-source nature. Some examples of products that can be used to make this
					project a reality is the Arduino Uno, WiFi Module - ESP8266, a SparkFun Low Current Sensor Breakout
					and an Adafruit breadboard just to name a few. To install this device into our customers’ homes we
					would need the specialities of a professional electrician that also has an in-depth understanding of
					what this device does. On the digital side of things, we would need to program both a capable AI
					that can pick up on the common patterns of our users but can also work in tandem with our mobile
					application. This mobile application would enable the users to have a look at the common patterns
					that our AI has picked up and change any settings that were implemented by the AI if deemed
					inaccurate or inappropriate for that time of day.<br />

					Now that cybersecurity concerned with safety on computer, defending computers from hackers and
					so
					on.We need to understand basic structure and train of working style of this system. We need to
					refer network security first, it is the major cybersecurity project, it protects integrity and
					accessibility from both hardware structure and software system. Every organization need to have
					skills to get solutions to avoid many risks.For hardware, especially many security management
					tools,
					we need to understand the structure and the train of working style of the hardware’s system.
					Because
					it can stop many hazards and threats like attackers from attacking device, data, applications
					and
					users.Three methods of securities are physical network security, technical network security and
					administrative network security. We need understand how these methods can achieve data and
					system
					protection, and avoiding unauthorized personnel controlling the network.There are many software
					that
					need us to understand the programming, giving instructions to let antivirus software and
					Firewalls
					to work. Antivirus software can protect our networks from virus, which are harmful to data and
					system like Worm and Trojan. Because at the first time, we cannot completely remove all the
					virus
					out of the system, we need to understand the skills to explore the system’s issue. Also,
					Firewall
					can isolate your trusted internal network from untrusted external work.Just like hardware,
					Firewall
					software can sometimes have some issue, this need us to explore and grasp the skills just in
					case of
					the second time it appears issue. In untrusted external network, there are probably a lot of
					criminals that waiting for you to get in trap and steal numbers of your personal information and
					data.

					As individual, the fee for the electricity use per households will be lowered as the product
					reduced
					electricity wasted. If it is commonly used among the households, it can also lower the unit cost
					of
					the electricity.As government’s perspective, there will be no need to generate power as
					previously.
					Because, the total amount of electricity use has declined due to the product. Also, the amount
					of
					resources used for generating the electricity, such as fossil fuel will be reduced. The
					government
					can use remaining budget to improve other things.Environmental problem can be realieved in some
					degrees as the use of fossil fuel is decreased. Always developing and reasearching are an
					important
					part for being more and more successful. Also, we will take more surveys from users to solve the
					problems to adapt with the market.

				<p>
					<center><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></center><br />
					The project is contrived to resolve one major problem in real life. It is immoderate electricity
					consumption. The more electricity being generated, the more resources will be consumed to generate
					it. Thus, reducing electricity consumption, even though the standby power doesn’t take that much
					part in electricity consumption, is really important to protect the environment ultimately as it not
					only delays the moment of resources being exhausted but also delays the Global warming caused by
					fossil fuel consumption to generate the power we use.<br />

					The major motivation came from an article that indicates how much does the standby power consumption
					costs annually, and how much does it affect the environment. This motivation also shares certain
					perspective that current IT trends require, maximize efficiency, minimize risk. Furthermore, it
					would be attractive to the future employers who are looking for project improving environment.<br />

					There are not that many competitors which share the same goal, to contribute to saving the
					environment by reducing the standby power consumption. However, there are some competitors which do
					similar work, such as AI home secretary. Just like our project can, it also has the same function
					like reminder, or a scheduler for the users.<br />

					<center><strong>DETAILED DESCIPTION</strong></center>
					<strong>Aim:</strong><br />
					In the creation of AI learning home system, the creation of multi-function gateway is undoubtedly
					the most important. The multi-function gateway connects other intelligent devices into Xiaomi cloud
					and smart home network through the latest wireless transmission protocol ZigBee (low power LAN
					protocol based on IEEE802.15.4). Many smart home devices adopt protocols, which are low-power,
					self-configuration and self-organized low-speed wireless LAN protocol, such as temperature and
					humidity sensor, human body sensor and smoke sensor, Smart socket, wireless switch, etc., these
					devices are placed in the right place according to the needs, and are not suitable for power supply
					of 220V, so it needs low-power transmission protocol; multi-function gateway realizes the conversion
					from protocol to WiFi protocol, and connects the intelligent equipment supporting ZigBee protocol to
					the gateway, and transmits the collected data to the user's mobile phone or smart sound via WiFi
					Control center. Many equipment in the living room adopt infrared remote control, air conditioning
					remote control, TV remote control, set-top box remote control, network box remote control, audio
					remote control, etc. each equipment needs a remote control, which is very inconvenient; universal
					remote control realizes the conversion from infrared to WiFi, and has built in many infrared remote
					control codes, and supports copying and learning, and converts the data of these remote control into
					WiFi Signal, through the mobile phone can be centralized control, and can set up intelligent scenes,
					a key to complete some columns of action.<br />
					In addition, universal remote control technology also has a huge role in AI learning home system.
					Universal remote controller is a kind of wireless transmitting and receiving device, which can
					decode various remote control infrared signals, store the received infrared signals and send
					infrared information again. Many equipment in the living room adopt infrared remote control, such as
					air conditioning remote control, TV remote control, set-top box remote control, network box remote
					control, audio remote control, etc., each operation of equipment requires a remote control, which is
					very inconvenient; universal remote control realizes the conversion from infrared to WiFi, has a lot
					of infrared remote control codes built in, and supports copy learning to convert the remote control
					data into WiFi Signal, through the mobile phone can be centralized control, and can set the
					intelligent scene, a key to complete some column of action. Next, Bluetooth gateway equipment is
					also essential. Bluetooth gateway is a data forwarding device, which usually integrates Bluetooth
					and WiFi two wireless communication modes. Bluetooth is usually ble low-power Bluetooth, which is
					used as the host to scan and collect Bluetooth device information and forward it to the designated
					server through WiFi. Some smart home devices use low-power Bluetooth protocol, such as Bluetooth
					temperature and humidity sensor, Bluetooth smart door lock, etc. How to connect the data collected
					by these devices and control data to the network? At this time, Bluetooth gateway equipment is
					needed to convert Bluetooth data into WiFi data. Bluetooth gateway is not a separate device. It is
					often integrated into an intelligent device, such as bedside lamp, smart alarm clock, smart audio,
					etc. it can access the Bluetooth device nearby, obtain the data of Bluetooth smart home, and convert
					it into WiFi signal to realize the control of AI learning home system.

				<p>
					<strong>Plans and Progress:</strong><br />
					Our project development started with a simple brainstorming session, we asked ourselves what would
					bring convenience to our lives? In a world that is continuously adapting and improving, what aspect
					of our lives can we improve?<br />

					After a few hours of going over everyone’s ideas, we shortlisted two ideas that we think would
					increase efficiency and lessen the burden in our lives. One of those two ideas was a smart spice
					grinder that would automatically grind a spice of the users’ choice to perfection by following
					recipes online or by personal preference via an integrated mobile application. The other idea was an
					AI learning smart home device hub that would learn common patterns of its users, such as when the
					lights are usually turned off and on and when the coffee machine is usually turned on. This helps
					reduce unwanted energy consumption in the household and in return helps the user save money as
					well.<br />

					After further analysis, we concluded that developing an AI learning smart home device hub would be
					more beneficial and impactful in the world we live in today. We believe that this device can not
					only help the user save money on their bills but also make their life better. At its core, this
					device is designed to communicate with its user through their actions and understand the user better
					through repetition. We plan to accomplish this by attaching our device either through the control
					panel or if possible, through a conventional wall socket for easy access and simple
					installation.<br />

					We started to look deeper into the disadvantages and advantages of our first mockup of the device
					and noticed that there was a huge problem that we could not address with our first draft. We did not
					take account of the randomness of human behavior. Most people do have a daily schedule that they
					follow but, in some cases, they might divert away from their norm. This can be seen when someone
					takes an unplanned leave from work or gets sidetracked from other problems around the house. With
					that being said we would like to be in a position to help reduce their problems and not add on to
					it. Because of that, we added a layer of customization and personalization to our product via a free
					integrated mobile application. This application will allow users to view their daily tendences
					detected by the AI and change them permanently or temporarily. The application would detect the
					device via its connection to the home Wi-Fi and give the user the ability to individually set a
					schedule for each of the smart devices connected to our AI learning smart device hub. This would
					also enable us to have a more user-friendly approach to connecting already existing smart devices to
					our hub by providing an audio-visual queue when users manually add their smart devices to the hub or
					when the device automatically detects smart devices around the user.<br />

					We then started working on the overall design of the device and the application itself. When
					designing the overall theme of the product and the application, we wanted our brand to look cohesive
					to potential buyers everywhere they went. Hence why we decided to base the design and color scheme
					of the device and application off our team website. We wanted to incorporate the minimalistic and
					light design of our website into both our application and device. We wanted a device that was
					compact and simple in design. We did not want to overload the device with multiple unnecessary
					indicators or buttons, we just wanted a device that did its job efficiently while retaining that
					sleek and minimalistic demeanor from the website. We wanted to design an application that acted as a
					virtual hub, helping the user understand the product and its capabilities better. Whilst not
					overwhelming the user with too much information, making sure to section out information properly and
					strategically. We also decided to go with a simple color scheme of purple, black and white. Keeping
					it true to our company colors whilst also providing the application and product a simple and subtly
					eye-catching identity.<br />

					After further research, we identified another feature that we think would be vital to taking this
					product to the next level. We identified that a common feature in already existing smart hubs were
					the inclusion of a virtual assistant. This can feature can be found in products such as the Amazon
					Echo Plus and the Google Home Hub. We think that adding this feature can help in the convenience
					aspect of our project but also does add a layer of difficulty in the development stage. We also
					concluded that a touch screen was not needed for the product itself and that the addition of decent
					quality speakers and a microphone was now essential to our product.<br />

					We are far from finishing this project as you can see but we do have high expectations for this
					project and believe that it can do well in the smart home device market. We are currently stuck on
					developing the second version of the product including the speakers, microphone and virtual
					assistant and working on the development and testing of the second version of the application that
					helps integrate and explain the new features in the application itself. Our knowledge of AI learning
					is limited and stands as a roadblock towards our continuous efforts to make this project a reality.
					We plan to address this problem by hiring an individual with more experience in this field but
					nothing is conclusive at the moment.<br />

					Here is a picture of what we think our product should look like and what the homepage of our
					application would look like.<br />
					<center>
						<img src="DanielPic1.png" alt="DanielPic1"><br />
						<img src="DanielPic2.png" alt="DanielPic2">
					</center><br />
					This product design is exactly what we envisioned, a sleek minimalist design that isn't over crowded
					and is fully functional. It provides the user with just enough information. The application design
					is also optimal for what we are going for as it incorporates the purple from our website and is
					finished off with a sleek off white finish in the background. It also has big prominent buttons that
					help with user experience.<br />

				<p>
					<strong>Roles:</strong><br />
					Yes, if you want to develop a complete set of AI learning home system, you need to have an
					electronic engineer. Electronic engineer refers to senior engineering and technical personnel
					engaged in research, teaching, product design, scientific and technological development, production
					and management of various kinds of electronic equipment and information system. Generally divided
					into hardware engineers and software engineers. Among them, the hardware engineer is mainly
					responsible for the analysis and design of the circuit of the AI learning home system, and designs
					the PCB with the computer software as the tool, and tests and debugs after the factory PCB is made
					and the electronic components are welded. Software engineers are mainly responsible for the
					preparation and debugging of embedded programs such as MCU, DSP, arm, FPGA and so on.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Scope and Limits:</strong><br />
					“There's no such thing as perfection. You're never finished with a film. You run out of time.” --
					Peter Jackson, director of `The Lord of the Rings’ and ‘The Hobbit’ trilogies. One of the more
					difficult parts of project planning and execution is to define the scope and limits of the project.
					As mentioned above, you never really complete project like these; all you can ever do is your best
					in the time available. Part of that involves setting priorities and accepting that there will be
					features that will take too long to develop. This means that it is important to
					set a scope for your project, as a means of ensuring that you make the most of the time available.
					For example, if you are developing a game, you might consider only producing one level and two or
					three characters, in order to show a proof-ofconcept, rather than develop three levels and ten
					characters. The scope is probably the most crucial part of your plan, and also the most difficult to
					define. One way to define the scope is to
					think of the deliverables for your project, i.e. what outcomes would you be able to show to someone
					who asks you to see the results of your work. This will also include several statements about what
					will not be part of the project. For example, if you are
					using Open Street Maps to show the location of all your favourite shops, the deliverables would
					include the updated map, but not the Open Street Maps technology itself. It would also not include
					many other features of Open Street Maps, or other interesting location -- just those which show your
					favourite shops. Also, be aware of the phenomenon of `scope creep', which is the tendency for
					projects to incorporate more and more features. There is nothing wrong with being ambitious, but you
					only have a certain amount of time. At least one paragraph is expected.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Tools and Technologies:</strong><br />
					Now that here is an AI system that can be used at home for the presenting of advanced technology, we
					must understand the tools to construct and the working process, also we need to understand the
					technology to let the system works.
					When we refer to tools, we can firstly come up with the ideas about software and hardware. There is
					a software, called Devices-Control for HomeKit, is a commonly used software to achieve automation at
					home, we need to write down the instructions to the software. We also need some hardware to achieve.
					For hardware, here must exists some devices like electric circuits’ structure and other device that
					relevant to computer to work, like storage that used to store recorded program and two
					telecommunication-used key components to send information by radio wave about what and when to do
					something on some particular computer objects.
					It is not so easy to have this technology when specialized, also we need license, in other words, we
					need some rights to do the tasks about this technology in the aspects of AI system. We must make
					sure the errors are completely “zero”. We also must ensure safety of customers and staffs. Also we
					can get further long period of benefits for our reputation.<br />
					We have experienced and had a look at this process of the technology. This shows us the advanced
					technology, and make us feel happy and pleasant. We do have less trivial things. Like many robotic
					furniture like cooker, bed and so on, they are all advanced.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Testing:</strong><br />
					In my future, I will probably practice this, then I need a test. If I need a test, I do need to test
					it when the time of science-technology show starts. However, I need to use some simple domestic
					device to do it, like informatization coffee machine. Before my test starts, I need to give the
					machine an instruction of what time to make coffee and what kind of coffee it needs to make in
					particular times.
					Although I graduate with doctor degree, I will still a newbie to practice this technology. I need to
					do the career for almost ten years, thus I can have a very specialized brain in this module. I can
					program it without any gaps before I test, when I test, I can get succeed. In ten years’ period, I
					will practice this module everyday, and include summary, also I need to get taught from all the
					failures of mess up. The longer I do it, I do believe that I will finish it, and 10 years is a very
					long period. By the way, where here is a plan, here will be no wrong product.
					If it involves some test user in the project, here I must record his or her number or email to
					contact and find him or her. So-called: There is strength in numbers. I must have more people to
					cooperate, and faster the project will get done. Maybe I need almost 100 workers to work together.
					Also, the premise is: they must finish postgraduate from some famous universities, this all depends
					on the company’s discipline.

				<p>
					<strong>Risks:</strong><br />
					First of all, the risk of different individual personality in the group is a major problem. It is
					hard for everyone to have an undenstand feeling link to other member. Furthermore, poorly of
					documented is an issue with our group. In this covid season, it is more difficult to find document
					making this AI circuit breaker. Finally, limited device support and requires IOS devices of Homekit
					software are a main issue with us.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Group processes and communications:</strong><br />
					Communication between individual members is the most important aspect of our project. There are no
					face-to-face meetings, so communication via Microsoft Teamwork is what are we doing. Meeting twice a
					week is not much with our group, however we replaced the lack of meeting by chatting to discuss. If
					a group member does not respond or come to the meeting, we try our best to get in touch with that
					member via canvas or by telling our lecture.

									I would say that our group dynamics stayed the same as with Assignment 2 and we
									didn’t
									have any major problems, we didn’t have any arguments and everyone did their parts
									well.
									Something that went well was the work ethic of other members and their dedication to
									get
									the project moving and done. Although we could’ve started the project earlier, the
									project didn’t really take off due to other subjects’ assignments also due and group
									members themselves being busy. The main thing that surprised me was that everyone
									still
									did their part on the project despite everyone having mismatching schedules and
									other
									assignments due, I was pleased to see that this project was still getting done even
									without much planning and communication and it turned out alright in the end.
									Something
									I learned about groups is to trust your group members and maintain a friendly
									demeanor
									and there won’t be any problems with the project. Our group didn’t use GitHub log of
									activity as we believe putting all the information in a collaborative MS document is
									much easier and convenient , and then transferring the completed copy to GitHub.

									I have done many assignments, and some assignments are finished by group working,
									they
									are always effective, this time, our group also has an effective meeting about
									assignment work.
									Everything was okay, everyone of us have our own opinion, so we can discuss and get
									consented one opinion. Every section can make us compatible and we can cooperate the
									work, this can be a suitable method to get a good work. After we discuss, I will not
									have such a painstaking works due to the others also do the works. But the most
									important one is as long as we get along each other, every questions will get
									solved. So
									for this group working job, we have done a very well process on not only plan
									effectively on working plan and also we have gotten along.
									Of course, we need to improve something. It is good to do well in get along, which
									means
									it is good for our career. But when we discuss, I think I need keep smiling and have
									a
									good hairstyle.
									The one thing that makes me surprising before. Because I have never used Microsoft
									Team
									before, I have just grasp the operation, I have seen Microsoft Team can show the
									screen
									video each other. This makes me feel happy and can understand each other’s
									situation.
									This time, I have understand the operation very well, it makes me happy again due to
									the
									previous time’s surprising.
									There is one thing that I have learned from my group. Because some works that need
									all
									of us to do. Because everyone has their own opinion. IT has many aspects. I have
									learned
									something about AI in home from one member. This project need me to understand and
									have
									a view in this phenomenon.
									I have used GitHub to do assignments in many times, I almost become familiar.
									Initially
									I don’t know the operation. I do sign in my own information in GitHub and understand
									the

									<strong>What went well:</strong> Unlike the previous assignment, we had very good
									and
									constant
									communication this time. We didn’t have to wait until the others reply nor have to
									check
									several times to make sure whether it is going well or not.
									<br />
									<strong>What could be improved:</strong> Everyone did well but I think teamwork
									could be
									improved. Such
									as feedback.
									<br />
									<strong>One thing I have learned:</strong>
									What I learned while working in the group is, Communication
									plays a huge role than I thought in the group work. As we were lacking communication
									last time and it came to us as a big obstacle to complete the given tasks. However,
									with
									the good communication this time, the overall work gone very well and we had no
									difficulties sharing our work.<br />
									<strong>At least one thing was surprising:</strong> I was surprised that everyone
									had
									great initiatives
									and responsibility for their work. We discussed whom to take the part and we
									willingly
									took the part that we were confident with.

									The group was fairly consistent throughout our time together working on Assignment 2
									and
									3. We all met on time to our scheduled meetings and recorded each session
									accordingly.
									We distributed the work evenly to the best of our ability and communicated fairly
									well
									through Microsoft Teams.
									<strong>What went well:</strong> Distributing the work evenly was pretty straight
									forward as everyone was open to taking up any tasks and was willing to venture out
									of
									their comfort zone for the betterment of our group.

									<br />
									<strong>What could be improved:</strong> I think that as a whole the group
									functioned
									well given the timeframe that we had and the circumstance that we have been put in
									due
									to the pandemic. Any improvements that I can think of can definitely be improved by
									just
									meeting in person and talking face-to-face, but due to the pandemic we could not do
									that.

									<br />
									<strong>One thing I have learned:</strong>
									I’ve definitely learned that communication is the key element in a successful group,
									with good communication comes teamwork, understanding and clarity of the project at
									hand. This group if anything has taught me that with good communication and
									determination anything is possible.
									<br />
									<strong>At least one thing was surprising:</strong> The majority of us were quite
									eager
									to learn more about the topic that we chose and conducted research of our own to
									better
									understand it as none of us have prior knowledge of AI programming.

									When our team was working together to complete the homework, the explanation of the
									task
									outline went smoothly. The team leader could present the content he wanted to show
									in
									the form of video, and explain the meaning of the video content clearly, so as to
									facilitate the team members' understanding of the task. Assigned to a task, but in
									the
									group is still there are some differences, some team members fail to understand
									their
									assigned to the task, thus greatly delayed the task arrangement efficiency, and team
									members is sometimes hard to all here, need to constantly informed and change time
									to
									task scheduling meetings in a timely manner, this also makes the meeting time is
									greatly
									elongated, so I hope the next group assigned tasks and that at the meeting, team
									leader
									can be more clear crew assignment, team members can be on time for the meeting. What
									surprised me most was that although the group members were all Asian, they generally
									had
									a high level of English and had little difficulty in communicating with each other.
									Moreover, they were all able to actively participate in discussions and ask
									questions.
									From this, I have learned that in order to finish the work faster in the collective
									task, we need to have a clearer plan and assignment of tasks, so as to greatly
									increase
									efficiency and reduce misunderstandings. In the tool section, GitHub can more
									clearly
									and efficiently reflect the work completed by team members and team leaders, and it
									can
									be more convenient to submit tasks.
