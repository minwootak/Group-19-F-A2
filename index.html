								<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Van Chanh VO and studying in RMIT with
								the
								student number 3748121. Vietnam is my

								me. I
								graduated English language programs and Foundation Study of science at RMIT. Spending
								time
								for playing games and playing soccer are also my hobby. Interested in exploring security
								computing and developing & designing website are what I want to study in Information
								Technology course. Getting experience of developing website and java language are In my
								period of Studying Information Technology. Working in the group with developing website
								for
								the second assignment, we discissed and decided to chose " Destiny " will be our group
								name.<br /><br />

								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> I have done 3 tests: Myers-Briggs Test, Learning
								Style
								Test and Creative Test for the
								Assignment 1. The results of these test tell me about my personality to adapt for life
								and
								work. These results may influence a lots of my behaviour in a team. It not only shows me
								but
								also with me team about advantages or disadvantages of my industries. It also showing
								the
								way for my-self to changing and contributing more for the team. Finding the best fit for
								the
								role is also a part of forming the team and do not forgot for willing to commit to their
								role.<br /><br />

								<strong>Industry Data :</strong><br />

								Leadership, mentoring and building effective relationships<br />
								After looked at the Burning Glass Data, my ideal job at Web Developer still does not
								change.
								Finding a job is an important part for me. So when looking at the Top IT Job through
								2017
								until 2018, I can see that Web Developer usually stayed in the middle of the Top IT Job
								Tittle ladder.

							<div class="content-hidden" id="HaoTa">
								<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Hao Ta and I am currently studying the
								Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT (s3844588). My family consists of 4 people,
								including my mother, father, older sister and I. While my nationality is Chinese, I was
								born
								in Vietnam and moved to Australia when I was 11 to pursue my studies. I am capable of
								speaking English and Cantonese. My family do not own any pets at the moment but I do
								want to
								own a cat and dog in the future! I completed Year 12 at Narre Warren South P-12 College
								in
								2019 and completed 2 IT courses in 2018, Software Development and Informatics as part of
								the
								VCE program. A fun hobby I like to indulge in is browsing Reddit! There are a lot of
								news
								articles on Reddit but also many discussions about various topics on there such as
								gaming
								and cooking. It's how I like to spend my free time.<br /><br />

								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> The results of the tests i did represent the
								dominant
								qualities about my personality, with some similarities between the Myers-Briggs test and
								the
								Big Five Personality Test. Myers-Briggs indicates that I’m a more introverted person
								than a
								social butterfly, and an observant person rather than directly leading others and taking
								action. Similarly, the Big Five Personality test suggests that I’m a quiet and reserved
								person and avoids taking on leadership roles. The learning style test indicates that I'm
								a
								visual learner and relies on diagrams and pictures to understand a problem, which I
								agree
								with.<br /><br />

								<strong>Industry Data :</strong><br />
								The highest ranked IT specific skill from my job is
								Microsoft Windows, and the rest aren’t even ranked ( except for Microsoft Office, but
								it’s
								still ranked pretty low, indicating that my job doesn’t contain many skills that are
								required by employers. The responsibilities listed in my job suggests that I require
								problem-solving,organisation and trouble-shooting skills, all of which are ranked high
								in
								the Burning Glass data list. The 3 highest ranked IT-specific skills which aren’t in my
								required skill set are ‘SQL’, ‘JavaScript’ and ‘JAVA’, and the 3 highest ranked general
								skills which aren’t in my required skill set are ‘communication skills’, ‘writing’ and
								‘teamwork/collaboration skills’.</br>
								Looking at the Burning Glass data I can form new opinions about the job. Looking at the
								list
								of Top IT Skills from March 2018 I notice that the skills essential in my job aren’t
								ranked
								high on the list except for Microsoft Windows. This brings a small concern to me as my
								ideal
								job doesn’t require the skills in which others think is good to have, if i manage to
								land
								the job in the future but later quit i wouldn’t have the set of skills many others have
								and
								that would put me in an unfavourable situation.</br>
								The Top Generic Skills list has ‘communication skills’ as the most desired skill by a
								landslide, which doesn’t sway my opinion on my job. Other entries on the list such as
								‘problem solving’ and ‘organisation skills’ also have little influence on my opinion as
								my
								job doesn’t require much talking and more focus on desk jobs.</br>
								The Top IT Job Titles features more ‘engineer’ and ‘developer’ jobs as opposed to desk
								jobs
								and ‘support’ jobs, but overall my opinion of my ideal job still remains pretty much the
								same.

								<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Haochen Wang, I study in RMIT
								University,
								my
								student number is s3701719. I am from Jiangsu Province in China it has a long history
								and
								famous culture, I am now in bachelor of information technology since 20th Jun 2020,
								because
								I want to get some particular job to develop my talent, maybe robots’ control
								technology.
								After my basic information, and I will refer other of my information about something
								belong
								to my favor, cooking, because of COVID-19, I do afraid that takeout’s package may
								contain
								virus, so I learn how to cook. I have cooked many meals and I have cooked meal for many
								times, so I have more and more interests. Robotic Control is one of the branch that I
								want
								to explore in my major of IT study. I am experiencing java language programming and
								GitHub
								website operation. Now I work in assignment 2 of intro to IT subject with my group
								member.
								So my group’s name is “Destiny”.<br /><br />

								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> I have got three tests: Myers-Briggs Test,
								Learning
								Style Test and Creativity Test. It is a good thing to get extraverted, this can makes me
								solve more and more problems. I always have intuitive energy. Besides, I have got
								interests
								in IT. It is good to feeling some particular systems’ working process in IT or any other
								science and technology. And then understand it. However, when it gets problem, or when
								we
								want to invent something unprecedent, we have to thinking. I know that in my future, I
								will
								face to some problems, thinking and exploring the issues is a only one method to
								develop,
								because when I understand the entire system and entire device, I can think and I can
								explore
								and fix it. Also, In my future, I want to invent something new to give people more and
								more
								convenience and more free time to spend on important works. This also let me think and
								then
								design. We have to consider before we plan. So judging is a better choice.<br /><br />

								<strong>Industry Data</strong><br />
								IT-specific skills and general skills must need ranking, especially need demands from
								employers. As an employer, I need employees need to have three of the highest skills,
								top
								three IT-specific skills and top three general skills. For IT-specific, employees need
								to
								have basic grasp like SQL, which is one important skill that need employees to
								understand
								the storage and manipulation of database. As long as IT, we need database to record.
								Then is
								JAVAscript, when refer to JAVA, we will firstly come up with one: JAVA Language
								Programming.
								This is a common program design in information technology. As long as we do understand
								programming, in the future, in our job, we can have the most accurate actions on
								computers
								without gap. Then Windows server is the third one, because Windows is the most common
								type
								of the computers, its server cares many aspects. Just pay many effects on server, we can
								have a deeper professionals in IT.<br />
								For general skills, we need to be creative, where here is a creativity, here will be
								probably a novelty. Also we need communication, this need us to build teams, thus we can
								communicate and organize, can probably solve problems. But before all the actions, we
								need
								to plan something properly. Because everything has its own process, for finishing
								without
								problems, we need planning.<br />
								I am just a newbie, I have only understand extreme little IT-specific skills, I have
								only
								one to five percent of JAVA and SQL, I have no idea about server, but I am pretty hope
								that
								I will have more and more experience after I finish postgraduate. Also, I am not so
								creative, maybe I have not touched enough eyesight in technology. Also I need to
								consider
								some ideas to solve problems by myself initially, I have to try it myself, if cannot, I
								can
								communicate. Also, I have no ability on management, because I have not do some works as
								a
								monitor, but it does not matter, in my job, I just do research in company.<br />
								I have seen the subjects in burning glass technology, because I am interested in
								robotics,
								which means robotic controlling is from a system. And it is a chance to study system
								engineering in IT as my ideal job. It can be said that my opinion just changed by a
								half.

								<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Minwoo Tak. My student number is
								S3818058.
								I am currently majoring in Information Technology in RMIT. I live in South Korea where I
								was
								born and raised.
								My family is consisted of 3 members. My parents and me. As I don't have any brothers or
								sisters. I loved play games alone when I was young.
								Playing games is still my hobby but also a milestone that lead me to IT. As My PC when I
								was
								young had terrible performance so I couldnt run any game on that PC.
								It made me to look for PC components to replace. while looking for them, I learned how
								those
								components function in computer.
								It ignited my interest of PC-related fields. and that is why I am learning Information
								technology.<br /><br />

								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> The result I got from the Myers-Briggs test is
								ISFP,
								Adventurer. People who belong to this personality type are likely to live their life
								with
								immediate inspirations.
								They love to break certain social frames and try different and diverse things that the
								others won't willingly try.
								I think I can utilize my personality when discussing with teammates like critical
								thinking
								to suggest unexpected weaknesses of idea.
								My learning style test indicates that I am a person who understand something better and
								faster with Auditory.
								I think this would function as a soft skill during the teamwork. Another test I did is a
								creativity test. I got 58.57 with this test.
								I think it shows that I am lacking of creativity a bit. but also whom should I
								collaborate
								with.<br /><br />

								<strong>Industry Data</strong><br />
								The most appropriate job listed on the Burning Glass data is network engineer.
								The way we ranked those job titles are, how much is it related to our major, or a job we
								want to be. As many of us wanted different job to get, we compared our ideal job and we
								figured out some fields that each ideal job shares. Such as major, or certain process we
								need to achieve to be employed as an ideal job, or even similarities among the works
								given
								for the job.<br />
								From your group’s ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs.
								These can be divided into general skills and IT specific skills.<br />
								- Among the skills I am required to achieve for my job, I see Microsoft windows, SQL,
								Network programming are listed on the graph. SQL and Microsoft windows are listed at the
								top
								of the graph. Which may mean, employers tend to prefer a worker with understandings or
								knowledge rather than a worker who is skilled at engineering.<br />
								- Most of general skills demanded by the employers were the skills required when working
								as
								team. The most demanded one is Communication Skills, which is most required in working
								as
								team for better cooperation and efficiency. Problem Solving also ranked right behind
								Communication skills. Which is also an essential skill to IT-related workers.<br />
								- Project management, Business management and Business analysis are the top three
								highest
								skills ranked among the skills not in my required skill set. I see these are not
								essential
								to me but I still believe some basic understandings of those skills are required. As the
								more understanding I have about how the businesses related my work go on, the better
								result
								will come out.<br />
								- I see Orientation skills, writing skills and planning skills are listed on the graph
								but
								not belonging in required skill set. Which are also not essential skills for my job.
								However, as I work as a team in this field, I believe being competent with these skills
								will
								make me more qualified. As I may face a situation where I need to report the current
								status
								of work.<br />
								- To be honest, I believed nothing else is needed as long as I achieve certain
								qualification
								for my job. Such as bachelor degree of IT-related major, or few years of apprenticeship
								or
								working experiences in similar field. However, after having looked at Burning Glass data
								which is indicating top demands of employers’ perspectives, my opinion is apparently
								changed. As Soft skills required by the employers were way heavier than I thought. I
								considered those general skills I need to achieve to get a job as certain degree having
								no
								difficulties working as a team. I also thought employers would prefer skilled worker
								regardless of how they are skilled in terms of general skills. Now I see general skills
								weigh more than I thought, as much as the employers consider the IT-specific skills the
								workers have got.

							<div class="content-hidden" id="Daniel">
								<strong>Personal Infomation:</strong> My name is Daniel Chong, I’m currently studying
								Business Marketing at RMIT University with the student number 3713285. I moved from
								Malaysia
								3 years ago to pursue this degree
								and I have no regret about my decision. I believe that moving to Australia provided me
								with
								the push I needed to better myself as an individual and as a future marketer. I spend
								my free time playing computer games and various sports such as ultimate frisbee,
								football
								and basketball. I’ve always been interested in IT as I also took a coding subject back
								in college where we used Java to create a short 2D game. Taking that subject just
								sparked my
								interested in IT even more. Even though I was not very good at coding, knowing how games
								were made and how the codes functioned together was really interesting to me. It was
								like
								going backstage to a show that I’ve watched all my life, it was intriguing and exciting.
								Nowadays I’ve found myself in a continuous journey to learn more about how technology is
								really shaping our lives. Through a subject that I did in my 2nd year I was giving the
								opportunity to build a website for a small business in Melbourne, at base level it was
								nothing technically at the coding side but I always found myself wanting to know how
								those
								elements appeared and interacted in the website. Hence why I enrolled myself into an IT
								subject in my 3rd year that had some coding inside but also gave me more understanding
								of
								the
								world of IT that I fell in love with all those years ago, Introduction to
								IT.<br /><br />

								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> I took 3 personality tests in Assignment 1 to
								access
								the type of individual I was and how my personality traits could benefit my teammates.
								The
								first test I carried out was the Myers-Briggs
								test and I got an INTP personality type. This means that I am a capable individual that
								strives to be better than I already am and am also open to change if it helps develop me
								as
								an individual.
								In a team environment, it means that I am open to new ideas and am ready to adapt for
								the
								team if needed. I have no problem taking the lead if needed and have no problem letting
								others take the
								lead as well.
								The second test I did was the Education Planner learning style test. Through this test I
								learned that I was predominantly a visual learner. This means that I’m the type of
								person
								that benefits more
								from visualizing the situation his in with the help of flash cards and color coding my
								notes. In a team environment I feel like this would affect my style of leadership as I
								would
								be more incline to
								ask my team to visual the problem that we are supposed to solve through the use of
								sticky
								notes and brainstorming using mind maps and other visual tools.
								The third test I took was a creativity test, for this test I got a score of 51.95. This
								means that I have a creativity score lower than the average but have two strong suites
								in
								the complexity and
								paradox branch. This means that I am able to carry large quantities of information,
								manipulate and manage the relationships between them (complexity) and have the ability
								to
								accept and work with contradicting
								statements (paradox). This puts me in a unique situation when it comes to creativity. I
								might not be the most creative person in the room but my willingness to work with
								contradicting and complex statements and
								try to make sense of it can add value when trying to solve a problem. In a team
								environment,
								my test results tell me that I would be more effective grouping myself with people that
								have
								a higher score in other
								creative departments like persistence, abstraction, connection and
								curiosity.<br /><br />

								<strong>Industry Data</strong><br />
								The ideal job title I chose was to become a Product Marketing Manager for Microsoft. The
								job
								title that I have chosen is consistent in terms of the demand and growth of the job
								itself.
								According to a CMO survey done in 2018, the marketing hiring growth remains positive but
								has
								slowed down recently and saw a slight decline in 2018.<br />
								<img src="DanielChong1.png" alt="DanielChong1"><br />
								Unfortunately for me, the results from the CMO survey also concluded that companies are
								more
								inclined to outsource their marketing
								duties to marketing agencies. This would mean that my prospect of working for a big
								company
								would be tarnished but it also opens the opportunity for me to look into working with a
								marketing agency to then form a partnership with one of the big companies that I was
								previously aiming for, like Apple, Microsoft, Google and Samsung. Overall, my job
								prospect
								as a Product Marketing Manager is stable and achievable. I would just need to go through
								a
								different path then I originally was planning to take.<br />
								The general skills in my required skill set ranks very highly in terms of demand from
								employers. The general skills in my required skill set were to have creativity, good
								communication, an above average attention to detail and a willingness to learn more.
								According to the CMO survey done, creativity is the number one skill looked at by
								employers
								nowadays and curiosity was listed as the third highest. In my personal opinion, good
								communication can be included as part of having natural leadership abilities.<br />
								<img src="DanielChong2 .png" alt="DanielChong2"><br />
								As I am aiming for a non IT centred job there were not a lot of IT-specific skills
								required,
								but the job description for my ideal job did mention that applicants should have basic
								knowledge of Microsoft Office and the Adobe Suite.<br />
								The three highest ranked general skills which are not in my required skill set are
								Emotional
								Intelligence, Martech platform experience and data science background.<br />
								After analyzing the marketing industry through the CMO survey, and Australian Government
								Job
								Outlook website, my opinion on my ideal job that I chose in Assignment 1, Product
								Marketing
								Manager has not changed. The industry trend and skills required are still in my opinion,
								favorable towards the route that I am planning to for. Even though the number of
								advertisers
								and marketers have increased throughout the years (between 2014 to 2019) the future
								growth
								in demand of advertisers and marketers is at a steady pace. The skills that are needed
								for
								the job are also in-line with my skill set. For example, being proficient in the English
								language, having the ability to develop a marketing strategy, being able to creatively
								solve
								a problem and promote a product and have the ability to manage and lead a team. The
								importance of maintaining a relationship with co-workers and teammates are also valued
								highly by both the marketing industry and I. This further amplifies my beliefs that this
								is
								the right job for me to pursue as teamwork and team cohesion is of great importance to
								me.
								Overall, I am happy that my first selection for an ideal job was the right one as it
								tells
								me that I am taking the right path went it comes to my future job and future
								aspirations.

								I
								chose this course, because I think the professional work sounds very cool, and my

								are engaged in profession is related to computer, so I hope I can as well as they can be
								a
								work in the computer, and it might also help to them. <br /><br />
								<strong>Three test outcomes:</strong> I take part in all tests .In these results, I know
								that I am diffidence man and do not like to talk with any other people, so that produce
								more
								and more people do not want to talk with me, I think that I should change this problems
								and
								do not be shy, be positive to take part in the group discussion, help any other group

								<strong>Industry Data</strong><br />
								I hope that is engaged in the industry for the IT aspects of the computer network
								security
								engineer, from "burning glass data" provided to my statistics, currently in Australia
								and
								New Zealand IT jobs demand by about 2-5 years work experience, but for the 0-2 years
								working
								experience, they are still popular, from a deeper perspective, New Zealand and Australia
								in
								the IT industry in the job market is far from saturation degree, and the number of job
								network security while relative to the entire IT industry accounts for the relatively
								small,
								but have some opportunities are greater than the average in the IT industry.<br />
								According to the data shows that the system is currently in development for Linux and

								Java and c # operation is still the most popular face object language, but it is not
								difficult to find that with the progress of science and technology, the Python language
								and
								ignored before the front end of the development is gradually emerging. What I need to
								learn
								includes C language, Java, PHP, C#. In the Java language, the spring framework of Java
								Web
								is required, while Tomcat of Asp/Vet is required in C#. Among those using Linux, I think
								the
								best choice is Ubuntu, which is now the most widely used operating system.<br />
								As far as database is concerned, the main categories are “Micsoft SQL
								Sever”,”Oradel”,”SQL
								Lite” and “My SQL”. For Australia, “Micsoft SQL Sever” is used the most, “Oradel” is
								used
								second, then “SQL Lite” and “My SQL”. And I will take the top two database types as my
								main
								study direction. In addition, I also need to learn front-end Javascript scripting
								language
								and HTML framework language, so that I can master more technologies in IT more
								efficiently.
								At present, SAP, IOS system and Python are not of great help to my current industry, and
								they will waste a lot of my time. Therefore, I will spend less time in learning these
								three
								IT technologies in the future.<br />
								In addition, if I want to be engaged in the NETWORK security technology industry of IT
								in
								the future, I need to learn more communication skills, problem solving ability, writing
								ability, leadership, guidance ability, organization ability, logical thinking ability,
								teamwork and communication skills, etc. But for the present my career, the most
								important is
								undoubtedly logical thinking ability, the second is teamwork and communication skills
								ability, finally, the writing and the ability to solve the problem, because these skills
								can
								better help me think of the possibility of more, strengthen the work and communication
								skills with others, thus greatly facilitated my writing and deal with the problem of
								efficiency, for the present I, guiding ability, leadership and organization skills but
								no
								less important, after all, now I'm at the new stage, the management level of things for
								a
								while is still hard to come into contact with, These abilities can be learned later when
								I
								have enough knowledge.<br />
								To sum up, again after I watched the "burning glass data”, before I change my childish
								view
								of IT and network safety engineering technology, I found if I want to learn the subject,
								to
								the type of knowledge needed to design and utility is huge, IT's not that I imagine that
								only need to learn how to write a program, so I will spend more time on this respect
								knowledge reserve, strive for the early work to reach the required standard.

						<h3>Clouds, Services, Servers</h3>
						<img src="Clouds, services, servers .png" alt="Clouds, Services, Servers">
					</center>
					<p>
						<strong>What does it do? <br /></strong>
						<strong>What is the Clouds,services,servers likely impact?<br /></strong>
						. More convenient use and storage: For some small and medium-sized enterprises, with the
						continuous expansion of their business, they may need to carry out capacity expansion and
						upgrading operations in the later period. If they use cloud host, there is no need to carry out
						corresponding upgrading operation of hardware and software in the later period. In addition,
						cloud hosts have a data backup function, which greatly reduces the chance of data being affected
						or lost. As cloud servers are maintained uniformly by service providers, they save a lot of
						human resources for enterprises.<br />
						. The stability of cloud server is relatively good: cloud server is a clustered server. For
						network attacks and other damage to the server has a higher defensive behavior.<br />
						. Faster response: The bandwidth used by the cloud host is interoperable by multiple lines, and
						the response speed is very fast.<br />
						<strong>Cloud computing servers mainly provide Internet-based infrastructure services for smes
							and
							high-end users. This user group has the following characteristics:<br /></strong>
						(1) The main business is host rental and virtual private server, and the scale is relatively
						large.<br />
						(2) Pay attention to the short-term return on investment, and have high requirements on the cost
						performance of products.<br />
						(3) Strong personalized demand, tend to the whole value chain products.<br />
						Compared with the existing VPS and rented physical servers, users can easily carry out remote
						maintenance and achieve complete isolation between cloud hosts at the hardware level of the
						reinstallation system for free. Built-in redundant Shared storage and intelligent backup,
						physical server failure can be automatically restored within a few minutes; The service
						environment USES high-end servers for deployment and centralized management and monitoring to
						ensure the stability and reliability of the business.Stronger host performance, the overall
						performance is much higher than VPS, stronger than some independent servers; Cloud servers cost
						less to rent than traditional physical servers and require no deposit. With fast supply and
						deployment capability, users can open the cloud host in real time after submitting the
						application for renting, and get the service immediately. Business support smooth expansion,
						when the user business scale expansion, can quickly achieve business expansion.<br /><br />
						<strong>How will Clouds,services,servers affect you?<br /></strong>
						To me, the role of cloud servers in today's world is no doubt comparable to the emergence of
						power plants in the industrial age. First of all, before the birth of cloud server, if I wanted
						to develop a software or website by myself, I had to purchase the server by myself and conduct
						daily inspection, debugging and maintenance. At present, if I want to develop software or
						website, I can use it directly from the operator concession server, which can greatly save my
						cost and energy and enable me to focus more on the development and application of the website
						itself. Just as with the advent of power stations in the industrial age, more people did not
						have to worry so much about how to get electricity, so they could spend more energy on how to
						use it.Subject to the restrictions of money, so I can't afford to buy a complete server,
						erection and maintenance, and with the emergence of the cloud, I this kind of independent
						developers can also be developed through its excellent Internet program, thereby significantly
						reducing the costs of my independent development and threshold, and attract more and more people
						in making more excellent program, so I for the junior programmer, gave me more reference
						learning opportunities, improve the ability of my core employment after graduation.As my family
						is not the developer of computer programs, the emergence of cloud servers has a relatively small
						impact on them, more reflected in the protection of personal privacy information, as well as the
						microcomputer virus defense detection ability has been significantly improved. In addition, due
						to the emergence of the cloud to cloud, the cloud computing, artificial intelligence, Internet,
						chain blocks, and a series of cloud product technology, greatly facilitate the daily life of
						people, in various fields in transforming our world gradually, make my family better able to
						enjoy the fun and convenience brought about by the cloud server, greatly improve their
						well-being and quality of life.

						<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
						<img src="Cybersecurity.jpg" alt="Cybersecurity">
					</center>
					<p>
						<strong>What does it do?<br /> </strong>
						One of the overarching challenges in the field of cybersecurity is its complexity and poor
						definition. In most other fields, the research community explores the boundaries of the research
						field while building on a core body of knowledge assembled over time. In contrast, the
						boundaries of the field of cybersecurity are constantly and rapidly evolving and it can be
						challenging to identify which areas have been researched and which ones remain overlooked or
						poorly understood. The field has a number of research gaps, for instance, there is a lack of
						research into national security issues, governance, ethics and legal concerns. Research in the
						field of cybersecurity seems to suffer from a scarcity of reliable, verifiable data, and
						particularly large scale, longitudinal datasets, across many of the clusters.The increased
						dependency on ICTs across society poses a challenge for governments in terms of how to best
						organise the governance of cybersecurity at a national level. It is increasingly important that
						countries anticipate, detect, mitigate and prevent a wide range of cybersecurity incidents and
						attacks, as well as coordinate these efforts between the public and private sector, both
						domestically and across international borders.Cybersecurity cannot be achieved without having
						access to appropriate levels of suitably qualified and experienced cybersecurity professionals.
						There is a range of human behaviours in cyberspace that compromise systems and render security
						protocols ineffective. Humans are continually a source of weakness for secure information
						systems, given that individual behaviours can lead to insecure activities (e.g. password re-use)
						and are vulnerable to social engineering attacks (e.g. phishing, impersonation,
						shoulder-surfing, etc.). Individual behaviour may also jeopardise other security interventions.
						Society simultaneously produces and consumes increasing volumes of data. As society increasingly
						relies on data and progressively autonomous analysis or decision-making aids – through
						technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence – it will become increasingly
						crucial to verify and assure data and emerging decision-making techniques to ensure that they
						are accurate and without bias and prejudice.
						With technology becoming more ubiquitous, being used in every sector, and replacing all kinds of
						manual tasks, we are becoming more dependent on computer-related hardware and software than ever
						before. There is therefore a significant need to ensure that there are appropriate mechanisms to
						test, certify, verify and assure that systems used across all aspects of society are secure and
						perform as expected – and continue to do so throughout their lifecycle. Cybersecurity failures
						can be caused by bad design, failure to implement appropriate cybersecurity arrangements, and
						human error.<br />
						There will be more hackers and they will continue to become more sophisticated with access to
						better tools. Small and medium-sized businesses will be targeted more often as many of these
						businesses lack information security knowledge and resources making them ideal targets.
						Additional privacy and cyber regulation will continue to be developed forcing businesses to take
						cyber security more seriously. Hackers will continue to be more sophisticated, using new methods
						and tools to gain access to private information. To defend against such cyberattacks, companies
						will need to use more effective security solutions with innovative approaches. For instance,
						companies will assess their cybersecurity as seen from the hacker’s point of view. The goal will
						be to not only increase cyber resilience internally within their specific company, but also
						across the company’s supply chain. The future of cybersecurity should have a heavy focus on
						using artificial intelligence (AI) to secure devices and systems in the increasingly connected
						world. The future of cybersecurity will center around industry adoption of 5G networks. 5G
						technology will enable billions of new devices to be connected to the Internet – with more
						speed, density and efficiency than ever seen before.. Therefore, 5G will result in a rise in
						cybersecurity concerns as hackers are provided greater access to entire networks, from remote
						sensors to self-driving cars and smart devices in supply chains worldwide.<br /><br />

						<strong>What is the likely impact? <br /> </strong>
						Nowadays, the necessity of cybersecurity is indispensable. Many countries are well aware of
						threats to cybersecurity and this is a main issue. Cyber attack will lead to information theft,
						sensitive data such as government data, hospital data and celebrity infomation. They are even
						spread harmful information, cheating and disrupting the operation of telecommunications
						networks, internet to cripple the system and making the data unavailable. Increasingly, cyber
						attack are going to grow stronger and faster in the future. With the development of
						cybersecurity, it will help to protect many informations and datas from theft, interruption,
						damage or other unauthorized or wrong actions. The people I say are affected the most here, are
						organizations, companies, governments, social media users and even users realate to internet.
						There are many companies are having cyber-attacked and without cybersecurity, the data of these
						company will be thieve and decrease the customer's believe of this them. So, how can we take
						benefits from cybersecurity? There are many answers for this question. First, cybersecurity will
						protect company, helping your employees to surf the internet at anytime they need and ensure
						that they do not have potential threats. Furthermore, with opportunities of spreading the virus
						and thieve informations and datas from other internet users or even customers of companies then
						selling or taking from that. As we can see, cybersecurity will protect and safety your
						information. Moreover, cybersecurity help you to work safe by protecting from potential network
						attack and virus forcing you to replace the computer. Preventing your website going down is what
						cybersecurity will protect. If company websites or normal user websites contain virus, so thoes
						websites can forced to shut down and maybe it will causing long term damage to the system. The
						cybersecurity jobs are in high demand and there seems to be demand for many security
						professionals in the future. Moreover, the role of computer science is in high demand and will
						increase in the future, so cybersecurity are creating many jobs and technologies now and time
						ahead.<br /><br />

						<strong>How will this affect you? <br /> </strong>
						Cybercriminals are becoming more and more frequent and dangerous because they can cause loss of
						privacy, confidentiality and privacy of personal data. It might be effect significant to
						reputational and financial losses. In my daily life, using technologies carefully on internet to
						avoid virus, receiving wrong information and especially cyber-crime. With some basic behavior, I
						can reduce the risk of cyber-crime and feel ut as a part of my daily life. First, avoid randomly
						password by protect my account with strong and unique passwords and combination of 10 uppercase
						and lowercase with letters, symbols and numbers. Also changing the password in every three
						months, so it will make more difficult for attackers to access my information. Secondly, do not
						be curious about messages, emails or attachments that I feel unsafe. In some ways, message can
						come from a cyber-criminal who compromised my friend or family member's mail or social media
						account. Finally, understand and being control when using public internet networks. Everything
						doing on the website or application can be steal, so avoid anything that involves sharing my
						personal information.

						<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
						<img src="MachineLearning.jpg" alt="MachineLearning">
					</center>
					<strong>What does it do? <br /></strong>
					<strong>What is the likely impact? <br /></strong>
					Machine learning enables computers to learn and act without being explicitly programmed. It evolves
					from the study of pattern recognition and the design and analysis of algorithms to enable learning
					from data and make possible data-driven predictions or decisions. Machine learning can dramatically
					increase the speed and accuracy of climate models. Machine learning is essential to the development
					of intelligent cars that can make quick unprogrammed decisions based on data, and to ensuring cars
					function safely. Machine learning can help contribute to the medicine field, allowing machines to
					analyze a plethora of patients' data with greater speed than humans’, and suggest treatments that
					may be overlooked by doctors.Small errors or bias in data may be magnified in the long run as
					machines will train on the faulty inputs, leading to decisions not best for us. Machines that
					operate on large amounts of unrelated data may find patterns or correlations in the data that are
					meaningless or useless, or actionable but wrong/inefficient.Back in 2016, the computer program
					“AlphaGo” defeated Lee Sedol, the Go world champion. Go is an ancient Chinese game, much more
					difficult for computers to master than chess. But AlphaGo was specifically trained to play Go, not
					by simply analyzing the moves of the very best players, but by learning how to play the game better
					from practicing against itself millions of times. I imagine in the future the bots that we play
					against will be much more intelligent and similar to almost playing against another human.Airplanes
					are already implemented with transportation automation - using “Flight Management System”, a
					combination of GPS, motion sensors and computer systems to track its position during flights.
					Self-driving cars however are more complicated, with more cars and obstacles on the road, and
					limitations to account for in terms of traffic lights and rules. Machine learning should allow
					self-driving cars to instantaneously adapt to changing road conditions, while learning from new
					roads at the same time. Cars currently require a driver present for safety, so in the future machine
					learning should allow so that cars can detect and follow driving conditions to drive
					safely.<br /><br />
					<strong>How will this affect you?<br /></strong>
					Machine learning is becoming more and more frequent in our daily life. As we can see. AI used to be
					a fanciful concept from science fiction, but now it’s becoming a daily reality. Taking the benefits
					and powers from machine learning, it will help us to gain the effect of a healthy life, happier and
					more successful. Machine learning is not only replace manual labor, but also mental labor.
					Self-Driving cars are the artificial intelligence and machine learning impact strongly in our
					everyday life. It is the accessibility for those people who cannot drive or even people who do not
					life driving or even scare of driving. Machine learning help us to reduce the pollution of
					atmosphere, also even noise pollution... To make the idea of the sentence above more solid,
					self-driving cars will be a typical representative. Moreover, making digital empathy and robots as
					friends are the big step of machine learning. As can we see, the day that we can " buy a friend" is
					not too far away. Furthemore, machine learning in health care section is a very important that
					cannot be ignored. Machine learning can help bridge the " knowledge gap" in medicine. It allow
					machines to anylyze many of patient data with much greater speed than humans are capable of, and
					suggest diagnoses or treatments that may be overlooked by the physician.

						<h3>Robots</h3>
						<img src="Robot.jpg" alt="Robots">
					</center>
					<strong>What does it do? <br /></strong>
					<strong>What is the likely impact? <br /></strong>
					Among the areas, my first love is robotic technology. It can substitute people to do works which
					have large amount of difficult calculation, it can avoid inevitable gaps which as for people to do,
					also it can do works even substitute people from dangerous conditions. Many robots can do works like
					constructing some particular objects like vehicles, they can do many and many projects in someplace
					like industry. Also, some robots have programmed, and do some works like carry boxes, they can
					identify boxes and particular carts by black and white square code on them. Domestic robots like
					iRobot can sweep floor and record landform of a house as well. Some robots like Cozmo and Vector,
					they can show emoji on their screen as surrounding condition is good or bad, they can communicate
					with people. Some domestic robots can play music and dance, they can look after people. Currently,
					robots’ highest technological level is artificial intelligence. AI is one technology that no need to
					program particular motion if it is used in robots, it has human intelligence. They can think and act
					like a human being, even thinking and acting instinctively as situation turns. Sometimes they can
					use AI to work even without human intervention. Just like this robot, Cruzr Health Monitoring robot,
					people can input instructions in its “brain”, it can detect someone’s body temperature and whether
					he or she is on mask during pandemics. If something abnormal, it will automatically ring the bell
					and notice everyone in one place like airport. Although robotic technology is advance, however it is
					not so advanced completely. For example, Boston Dynamics------an American robotic company has a
					famous robot Atlas. This robot is advanced, it can be autonomous, they can detect obstacles by
					themselves, they can do carrying boxes. Also, it can walk through rugged ground and narrow bridge
					without falling down. But they are very slow when they walk through rugged place, so there is one
					important thing that can be down for now. Staff of Boston Dynamics always study further and further,
					there is one thing that can be done, keep balance when walking through rugged place and narrow
					bridge, simultaneously have a faster speed to calculate the balance on gravity and friction and
					angle and force when walking.<br /><br />

					<strong>How will this affect you?<br /></strong>
					It can affect me very much, not only me, but everyone, they can substitute me to do works that makes
					me feel happier and happier to see higher and higher technology, when I in working career, robots
					makes me get affected about my knowledges and understandings of robotic control, design, structure
					and system. If better, I can become a scientist on robotic development. In my home, robots can do
					works, when they do works, they do substitute me to do, because I can be very busy and at the same
					time, I still want my house to keep clean and tidy, so robots can do it. Also it can give me much
					more fun and entertainments. Also, it can help me solve problems. For example, if I find something
					goes wrong when I do some works, robot can tell me what to do by Cloud Web. In my daily life, it can
					help me make my life convenient and reduce trivial time. It can help me make up some projects
					without any mistakes and without any gaps. If I work in hospital, robots can identify who is serious
					patient to reduce risk of infection. We all know that in previous era, people can only program the
					particular actions and movements in robot’s “unadvanced brain” although they invent robots, but they
					still need to do complex works by themselves. Now robots are advanced, even have ability to think
					and act as a human, people and I can have convenient life and have much more enough time to do
					something which I must finish in certain time. Of course, robots can have better affects on members
					of my family and my friends. Currently, robots can identify face and fingerprint of particular
					person to know him or her. When my family members or friends having party, I can tell the robots to
					do something like have fun with us, or tell the robots to do something about service, if I tell the
					robots that Jack want a glass of apple juice, robots can use its data storage to find apple, glass
					and juicer it puts in particular place and make juice, it can identify Jack’s face by its recording
					database and send juice to him.
