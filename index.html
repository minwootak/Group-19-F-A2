      <center>Hao Ta</center>
      <p>My name is Hao Ta and I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT (s3844588). My
        family consists of 4
        people, including my mother, father, older sister and I. While my nationality is Chinese, I was born in Vietnam
        and
        moved to Australia when I was 11 to pursue my studies. I am capable of speaking English and Cantonese. My family
        do
        not own any pets at the moment but I do want to own a cat and dog in the future! I completed Year 12 at Narre
        Warren South
        P-12 College in 2019 and completed 2 IT courses in 2018, Software Development and Informatics as part of the VCE
        program.
        A fun hobby I like to indulge in is browsing Reddit! There are a lot of news articles on Reddit but also many
        discussions
        about various topics on there such as gaming and cooking. It's how I like to spend my free time.
      </p>
      <p>The results of the tests i did represent the dominant qualities about my personality, with some similarities
        between the
        Myers-Briggs test and the Big Five Personality Test. Myers-Briggs indicates that I’m a more introverted person
        than a social butterfly,
        and an observant person rather than directly leading others and taking action. Similarly, the Big Five
        Personality test
        suggests that I’m a quiet and reserved person and avoids taking on leadership roles. The learning style test
        indicates that
        I'm a visual learner and relies on diagrams and pictures to understand a problem, which I agree with.

      <center>Haochen Wang</center>
      <p>My name is Haochen Wang, I study in RMIT University, my student number is s3701719. I am from Jiangsu Province
        in China
        it has a long history and famous culture, I am now in bachelor of information technology since 20th Jun 2020,
        because I want
        to get some particular job to develop my talent, maybe robots’ control technology. After my basic information,
        and I will
        refer other of my information about something belong to my favor, cooking, because of COVID-19, I do afraid that
        takeout’s
        package may contain virus, so I learn how to cook. I have cooked many meals and I have cooked meal for many
        times, so I have
        more and more interests. Robotic Control is one of the branch that I want to explore in my major of IT study. I
        am experiencing java
        language programming and GitHub website operation. Now I work in assignment 2 of intro to IT subject with my
        group member. So my group’s
        name is “Destiny”.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have got three tests: Myers-Briggs Test, Learning Style Test and Creativity Test. It is a good thing to get
        extraverted, this can
        makes me solve more and more problems. I always have intuitive energy. Besides, I have got interests in IT. It
        is good to feeling some
        particular systems’ working process in IT or any other science and technology. And then understand it. However,
        when it gets problem,
        or when we want to invent something unprecedent, we have to thinking. I know that in my future, I will face to
        some problems, thinking
        and exploring the issues is a only one method to develop, because when I understand the entire system and entire
        device, I can think and
        I can explore and fix it. Also, In my future, I want to invent something new to give people more and more
        convenience and more free time to
        spend on important works. This also let me think and then design. We have to consider before we plan. So judging
        is a better choice.

      <center>Minwoo Tak</center>
      <p>My name is Minwoo Tak. My student number is S3818058. I am currently majoring in Information Technology in RMIT. I live in South Korea where I was born and raised.
         My family is consisted of 3 members. My parents and me. As I don't have any brothers or sisters. I loved play games alone when I was young.
         Playing games is still my hobby but also a milestone that lead me to IT. As My PC when I was young had terrible performance so I couldnt run any game on that PC.
         It made me to look for PC components to replace. while looking for them, I learned how those components function in computer.
         It ignited my interest of PC-related fields. and that is why I am learning Information technology.</p>
         <p>The result I got from the Myers-Briggs test is ISFP, Adventurer. People who belong to this personality type are likely to live their life with immediate inspirations.
         They love to break certain social frames and try different and diverse things that the others won't willingly try.
         I think I can utilize my personality when discussing with teammates like critical thinking to suggest unexpected weaknesses of idea.
         My learning style test indicates that I am a person who understand something better and faster with Auditory. 
         I think this would function as a soft skill during the teamwork. Another test I did is a creativity test. I got 58.57 with this test.
         I think it shows that I am lacking of creativity a bit. but also whom should I collaborate with. </p>
